India is the world's largest manufacturer of hydroxychloroquine, which is used in the treatment of malaria.

But, its demand has now increased after US President Donald Trump requested the Indian government to allow its export to America to treat COVID-19 patients.

""We have come to know that people were rushing to medical stores to buy hydroxychloroquine after it came in news and was also mentioned as an effective medicine by US President Trump for those infected by COVID-19,"" Gujarat Food and Drug Control Authority Commissioner H G Koshia told PTI.

It has come to light that many people are taking the medicine or stocking it due to the coronavirus fear, he said.

""This is a scheduled H drug, which can be sold by chemist on a prescription of a registered medical practitioner. It is not in the interest of normal people to take the scheduled H drug if they do not have COVID-19 symptoms, he said.

This type of self-medication can cause harm and side effects if not taken under proper care of doctors, he warned.

""Therefore, we have advised people not to take the medicine without the prescription of doctors. We have also asked chemists not to sell the drug to patients coming without the doctors' prescription,"" the official said.

Chemists have been asked to maintain a register of purchase and sale of the drug, which they have to do for all the scheduled H drugs, he said.

A chemist in Bopal area of Ahmedabad said many people come to his store asking for hydroxychloroquine in a day, but he sells it only to those who have proper prescription.

Koshia said the Gujarat government has enough stock of the medicine, but an advisory has been issued so that there is no shortage of the drug in the open market.

""If everybody starts stocking or consuming the drug, it will create shortage in the market. This advisory is issued so that this anti-malarial drug is available for patients who need it, he said.

The Gujarat government stockpiled over one crore shots of the medicine as it became clear that this can be a useful medicine against coronavirus, he said, adding that the drug is manufactured in a large quantity in the state.

""The Food and Drug Control Authority of Gujarat has given approval to 28 companies to produce hydroxychloroquine. Of these, three companies produce active drug ingredients, which are raw material for production of the medicine, he said, adding that Gujarat will not face its shortage.

Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani recently said three companies from the state have been asked to produce hydroxychloroquine to export it to the US, after President Trump asked the Indian government for its supply.

On the effectiveness of the drug in the fight against coronavirus, Koshia said some studies, especially in France, say that it works.

""The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has recommended that this drug should be given to frontline health workers who are involved in treating those suffering from COVID-19, he said.

Earlier, India had banned the drug's export after it was found that it can be key to the treatment of COVID-19.

However, after requests of US President Trump and from other countries, the export curbs were partially lifted.

Gujarat has so far reported over 570 COVID-19 cases and 26 deaths."
https://www.deccanherald.com/international/us-president-donald-trump-says-china-will-find-out-consequences-for-misinformation-on-coronavirus-825166.html,"US President Donald Trump has hinted that there would be consequences for China's alleged misinformation to the international community and the WHO on coronavirus, that originated from its Wuhan city last year, and has claimed 119,666 lives with nearly two million infections globally.

Trump shot back at a reporter on Monday during his White House press conference on coronavirus when repeatedly asked why there are no consequences for China.

""How do you know that there are no consequences?"" Trump asked.

""I wouldn't tell you. China will find out. Why would I tell you?"" Trump replied when repeatedly asked if China was going to face the consequences of the alleged misinformation.

""You're going to find out,"" Trump said as members of the US Congress ramped up their rhetoric and move against China.

Senator Steve Daines sent a letter to Trump urging him to end the US government's reliance on medical supplies and equipment from China and bring back drug manufacturing jobs to America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The COVID-19 pandemic has made clear how relying upon China for medicine or essential medical equipment and components is detrimental to our national security and endangers public health,"" Daines wrote.

""It is critically important to ensure that legislation is fully implemented as quickly as possible and that the US continues to be the world leader in biomedicine, pharmaceutical development, and medical innovation,"" he wrote.

Four Republican lawmakers on Monday introduced a legislation to reduce the reliance on China.

Protecting our Pharmaceutical Supply Chain from China Act gives companies economic incentives to manufacture pharmaceuticals and medical devices in the US, makes it easier to know which country a drug came from by creating a list of the country of origin of all drugs marketed in the United States, and prohibits federally qualified health facilities from purchasing pharmaceutical products from China, it said.

""Relying on the Chinese Communist Party—whose lies about coronavirus created the pandemic we now face—for essential medicines is dangerous and short-sighted. As with 5G networks, when it comes to medical supply chains, national security must take precedence. China is an adversary that will use any US dependence as blackmail to achieve its nefarious goals,"" said Congressman Liz Cheney.

China ran a disinformation campaign to cover up the coronavirus crisis for weeks, putting the rest of the world at a disadvantage in combating the spread, alleged Congresswoman Elise Stefanik.

""We have become far too dependent on China, and it is time that we equip our domestic pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers to be able to efficiently produce these items here in the United States,"" she said.

Congressman Mike Gallagher alleged that the Chinese Communist Party's outrageous threats to withhold life saving drugs from the US endangers public health and should open eyes to the dangerous over-reliance on China in medical supply chain.

""This is a national security imperative that to many Americans, is a matter of life and death. It's past time for us to develop an aggressive plan to move critical pharmaceutical supply chains away from China,"" he said.

Congressman James Comer along with members of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform wrote a letter to the Director-General of the World Health Organization requesting documents relating to their assistance in the Chinese government's coronavirus propaganda efforts.

The WHO receives significant financial support from American taxpayers, including as much as USD 513 million in 2017.

The letter notes that as recently as January, the WHO promoted Chinese propaganda on social media in claiming that the coronavirus does not spread by human transmission.

The organisation likewise criticised travel restrictions implemented by President Trump, praised China's efforts to fight coronavirus even as the Communist regime was jailing doctors, and bowed to Chinese influence by delaying labeling COVID-19 a pandemic, the lawmakers said.

Another group of Senators - Marco Rubio, Marsha Blackburn, John Cornyn, Kelly Loeffler, and Joni Ernst in a letter urged Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and US Permanent Representative to the United Nations Kelly Craft to address the crackdown of free speech in China and in countries across four continents including Turkey, Bangladesh, Niger, and Cambodia, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The Chinese Communist Party is using this public health emergency as a thin veil to cover a crackdown on peaceful dissent and freedom of speech,"" the Senators wrote.

""Sadly, China is not unique in its utilization of the pandemic as an excuse to institute surveillance measures or draft new laws that are not necessary, proportionate, transparent, or time-bound,"" they said.

""Therefore, we call on the Department of State to document acts of harassment, arrest, increased surveillance, or other forms of suppression or criminalisation by regimes in retribution for those nations’ citizens expressing their freedoms through media, social media, peaceful assembly, or other peaceful means,"" the Senators said.

Globally, the coronavirus pandemic has killed 119,666 people and infected almost two million people, with US being the worst affected country leading in the number of infections and deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University data."

He said that the Centre will closely monitor the situation in each state and if cases of coronavirus rise in any region, the relaxation will be withdrawn and complete lockdown will be imposed again.

The PM stated that the relaxation after April 20 will continue only if the concerned states are able to curb the menace of coronavirus and the citizens strictly follow the norms of social distancing.

https://www.deccanherald.com/sports/coronavirus-lockdown-para-athletes-face-tough-time-825148.html,"A life of a para-athlete is tough enough in a normal world. So obviously, it will only get more difficult in a situation like this,” Niranjan Mukundan tells DH.

The COVID-19 enforced universal lockdown hasn’t spared people of any sphere and sportsmen are just one set of them. But for specially abled athletes it has been particularly strenuous.

Niranjan, who was born with spina bifida, is a former junior world champion in Para Swimming. The 24-year-old multiple international medal-winner, points out how daily life isn’t easy for disabled athletes during lockdown. “Para athletes use special equipment to train and that’s not available at homes and gyms of apartments,” points out the gifted swimmer.

“Also, an abled athlete can take instructions from his or her trainer through phone calls or video interactions. On the other hand, a para athlete needs the help of another person in most cases. A specialised trainer knows your strength and weakness.

“Without the trainer’s presence, I make mistakes and it is bound to happen with other athletes as well. Another disadvantage is, given our condition, motivation plays a huge factor and it’s unsettling to not have someone encouraging you always,” explains the Bengaluru boy.

Niranjan believes in looking at the positives. “Look, I am a swimmer and it can slightly get depressing to not enter the pool. It’s different from other sports. You can manage with wall shots if you are a badminton or a tennis player. You just need a table to play table tennis. I am in constant touch with my coach on video calls. I am focusing on fitness with my dry land routines,” he says.

Farman Basha, a multiple Para Asian Games medallist powerlifter, highlights the danger of getting injured. “Suppose you are doing a barbell bench press and without any guidance if you push yourself, you will definitely hurt yourself,” says Basha, who is afflicted with poliomyelitis.

The Paralympian is also worried about the accessibility factor. “To maintain a proper diet is a challenge. Though I stay in the Sports Authority of India campus I still need certain food materials from outside. I hope somebody takes up an initiative to help us in this aspect.

“I was stopped by the police when I was going to meet my ailing father. I had to convince them that I had stepped out for an important reason. You can imagine our plight when we are stranded on the road,” says the Arjuna awardee from Karnataka.

Basha says the State and National Paralympic associations must work on conducting online classes for para athletes to help them stay focused.

Sundar Singh Gurjar, the World Para Athletics champion, stresses on maintaining good mental health. “Practicing at home is different from handling the pressure on the field. It can affect your mind if you are not competing for a long time. Disabled athletes must regularly practice yoga and meditation,” says the Rajasthan javelin thrower, whose left-arm was severed in an accident."

In light of the challenges that coronavirus has thrown up, enforcing the lockdown and social distancing even while maintaining law and order can further stretch the already stretched police force.

""Drones and AI will help maximise the police's reach in dense, difficult to reach pockets and become their eyes in the sky,"" said Deshmukh.

According to him, the technology will allow the police to address people and instruct them to disperse if there is crowding.

""It will also be able to contain the exposure of the police personnel if this is a contaminated area.""

Exports fell 6.6 per cent in March from a year earlier and imports dropped 0.9 per cent, according to Customs data released Tuesday.

The contraction was less than a Bloomberg economist forecast that predicted a decline of at least 10 per cent in both figures, and well below the 17.2 plunges in exports seen in the first two months of the year.

But analysts warned that a broader recovery would be hamstrung for as long as the viral pandemic ravaged China's trading partners.

""The worst is still to come for China's export sector,"" cautioned Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics.

This comes after the Supreme Court directed states and union territories to consider decongesting jails in view of coronavirus threat.

Sources said that the J&K Home Department revoked detention orders of 36 persons lodged in different jails. The detainees whose PSA was revoked are lodged in Central Jail in Srinagar (16), Kot Bhalwal Central Jail in Jammu (16), and one each in district jails of Kupwara, Anantnag, Bhaderwah and sub-jail Hira Nagar.

Under the PSA, the government is empowered to revoke detention orders passed by district magistrates.

Sources revealed that the government has also decided to revoke PSA detention orders of 30-40 prisoners lodged in jails outside Jammu and Kashmir. “To begin with, the government would release 30-40 such detainees,” they said, adding that detention orders are being revoked on recommendations of deputy commissioners, district police chiefs and the J&K Police’s intelligence wing.

Earlier, 51 persons during the past two weeks were released from different jails after their PSA orders were revoked by the Home Department.

A senior official said the process of revoking PSA detention orders of those lodged outside UT jails was impeded due to nationwide lockdown announced by the Centre to control spread of COVID-19.

After the abrogation of Article 370 by the BJP-led Central government on August 5 last year, a few thousand people were detained under different laws in J&K. Of them, 500-600 were held up under the PSA.

Politicians in Kashmir, human rights activists and families of detainees lodged in and outside the UT jails are making pleas to bring back prisoners and many of whom have been detained under preventive detention after the August 5 last year. Families say many of the detainees are either of vulnerable age and some have underlying health conditions.

States like Maharashtra, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh have also released prisoners held for petty crimes on parole or furlough in the wake of the pandemic. Maharashtra released 11,000 such prisoners last month, fearing that COVID-19 would spread among jail inmates."
