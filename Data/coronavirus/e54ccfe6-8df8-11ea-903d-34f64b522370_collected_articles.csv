A 52-year-old woman working at Amma Unavagam (Amma canteen) tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. She was working at the Gajapathy Lala Street branch near Triplicane in Chennai. Amma Unavagam is a scheme run by the government of Tamil Nadu, providing subsidised food.

The woman has been shifted to Omandhurar Government College and Hospital. Following the report, the Amma Unavagam in Icehouse has been shut and all the employees of the branch are being tested.

In April, the Greater Chennai Corporation, which runs over 400 Amma canteens, said it would serve free food during the lockdown. However, after the government announced that hotels and other food services could operate (only parcel services) after May 4 in non-containment areas, the authorities in-charge of Amma Unavagam instructed respective zonal officers to cancel the free food initiative.

On Monday, Amma Unavagams saw a lukewarm response, with people having to shell out from their own pockets for a meal. Migrant laborers and the needy were thriving on the free food of Amma Unavagams.

Meanwhile, Koyembedu wholesale market in Chennai has turned into a Covid-19 hotspot after 107 people, mostly vendors, loaders, and other workers, tested positive in Cuddalore. All of them are linked to the Koyembedu cluster.

So far, 129 positive cases from Cuddalore, 76 from Villupuram, 63 from Chennai, 42 from Ariyalur, seven from Kancheepuram, and one from Perambalur, Thanjavur, and Tiruvarur are linked to the Koyembedu cluster. Massive contact tracing is underway in the state to find out who had visited the place in the last few weeks.

In Tamil Nadu, 3,023 people (2,015 male, 1,007 female, and a transgender) have tested positive for Covid-19. Of the total cases, Chennai accounts for 1,458 cases, about 48 per cent. On May 3 alone 203 people tested positive in the capital city of Tamil Nadu.

There are 1,611 active cases in Tamil Nadu and 1,379 people have been discharged following treatment. A 44-year-old male from Coimbatore who was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Chennai died on Sunday, taking the death toll to 30 in the state.

They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work.‚Äù

The Khans are the high-flying superstars of Indian Airlines Colony in Begumpet, Hyderabad. Even as the entire nation grapples with the novel coronavirus pandemic amid a nationwide lockdown, the Khans are at the forefront of fighting COVID-19, as a family.

On March 3, after several weeks, the three doctors in the Khan family were at home together after a felicitation ceremony where they were showered with rose petals by residents of their colony. ‚ÄúThey are the real heroes. They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work,‚Äù says Gopal Giridhar, a colony resident.

With 22 years of service, Dr Mahboob Khan (56) now works as Superintendent of the Government Chest Hospital which is treating many Covid-19 patients. Despite this, the pulmonologist was overwhelmed by the unprecedented show of support from his neighbours, that too at a time when many doctors across India are facing hostile neighbours. The family has been living in the neighbourhood for the last six years.

‚ÄúYes, we were scared initially as we were dealing with an unknown enemy. Anyone could get infected. There were incidents of medical and health workers contracting the disease and some even lost their lives,‚Äù admits Dr Khan who was part of the team of doctors and experts sent from Telangana to Kerala this February to study the latter‚Äôs experience of dealing with the disease.

Rajender, president of the residents welfare association, is happy that the felicitation was a success. ‚ÄúWe did not have enough time and in the short notice, we could mobilise so many people. This means that our people would come out for a good cause even in times of a pandemic,‚Äù he says, adding that they took special care in ensuring people maintain social distance during the small event.

Telangana recorded its first active case on March 1 and by the third week there was a sudden surge in the number of positive cases after 10 Indonesian nationals who reached Karimnagar after participating in the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi were tested positive for the disease.

As of May 3, Telangana has had 1,082 positive cases. As many as 545 of them have been discharged and sent to home quarantine. There are 508 active cases in hospitals, whereas 29 have succumbed.

Dr Khan‚Äôs 48-year-old wife Dr Shahana Khan works at the Gandhi Hospital where their daughter Dr Rashika Khan (22) is a house surgeon. Gandhi hospital, the nodal centre for treating COVID-19 in the state, treated almost 90 per cent of the total 545 patients cured of the disease so far.

The trio has seen hundreds of patients now. But is the daily stress of taking on this unknown enemy, tiring Dr Khan out? ‚ÄúNo way. Dealing with the disease requires us to constantly update ourselves. The appreciation and encouragement keeps us going,‚Äù he says.

However, as an administrator, he agrees, the last month has been stressful. Many a time, when the doctors or health workers found themselves in doubt, it was up to the administrative head to keep the flock together. Taking the medical and health community together with conviction, motivating them, and boosting their morale was a challenge initially.

‚ÄúI say time is the best medicine,‚Äù he says, pointing out that there was panic among doctors, health workers, patients, and the society. Health workers were asked to stay away from their homes and localities. Now the same society appreciates their work, he says. This, according to him, is because of the high recovery rates of patients.

Covid-19 has become part of their lives and is the most common topic of discussion at their dinner table, adds Dr Shahana. ‚ÄúI have to take care of our home too. I cannot neglect the family and patients are equally in need of us. So we do not hesitate to discuss Covid-19 at home and that helps,‚Äù she says.

With no domestic help available, Dr Shahana says her work at home has only doubled. She points at her mother, 72-year-old Azimunnisa Begum, who stays with them. ‚ÄúEspecially now, she needs more care. She is diabetic and has hypertension,‚Äù she adds.

Meanwhile, relatives and friends are worried for the family‚Äôs well-being. The family is flooded with phone calls from relatives across the country. Friends, too, keep checking on them. ‚ÄúThey appreciate our work and say they are proud of us. That is great to hear,‚Äù adds Dr Khan.

For the youngest doctor in the family, it was almost a baptism by fire. Dr Rashika had always wanted to become a doctor like her parents. ‚ÄúBut I never expected my internship to start this way. From Day One, everyone is posted in COVID duty,‚Äù says Rashika, who completed her MBBS just recently. For house surgeons like her, this has been a scary experience as none of them knew anything about the disease. ‚ÄúWith all the guidance from our seniors, all of us interns are now doing a good job and no one would believe we are fresh interns,‚Äù she adds.

Rashika‚Äôs younger brother Rehaan (18) is also a doctor in waiting, says the family, adding how they are currently preparing for the upcoming NEET exam. Having three corona warriors at home has inspired him further. ‚ÄúI just remind myself that I have three family members fighting a huge pandemic. This pushes me to achieve my goal,‚Äù says Rehaan.

To all those who fear contracting Covid-19, Dr Khan says there is nothing to worry about. The government and the health department are closely monitoring the developments and the citizens need to merely follow the instructions and stay at home, he emphasises. ‚ÄúThis may continue for another month and it might take six to seven months for the disease to vanish. But the same situation may not prevail. It is the responsibility of the public to help fight the virus by staying at home,‚Äù he adds.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs comments.

Ramping up its attack against Beijing, the United States has said that there is a ‚Äúsignificant amount of evidence‚Äù that the novel coronavirus, which has infected millions worldwide, emerged from a Chinese laboratory. China, however, accused the Donald Trump-led administration of ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù and sought proof to justify its statement.

Speaking to ABC news on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, ‚ÄúThere is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.‚Äù

Pompeo, however, briefly contradicted the US intelligence agencies‚Äôs conclusion that the virus was neither man-made nor genetically modified.

‚ÄúThe best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,‚Äù he said.

When the interviewer pointed out that was not the conclusion of the intelligence agencies, he backtracked, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they‚Äôve got it wrong.‚Äù

The State Department is yet to issue any clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs remarks.

Responding to Pompeo‚Äôs remarks, China‚Äôs Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party‚Äôs official People‚Äôs Daily, said in an editorial that he did not have any evidence the virus came from the lab in Wuhan and that he was ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù. It also asked the US to provide proof in this regard.

‚ÄúThe Trump administration continues to engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic,‚Äù the editorial said.

The entire Intelligence Community (IC) has been consistently providing critical support to US policymakers and those responding to the virus, which first broke out in China, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2020

‚ÄúThe Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,‚Äù ODNI said giving its assessment about the infection.

Read in Malayalam here

‚ÄúThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,‚Äù it added.

Last week, Pompeo had said it was not known whether the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a meat market, or somewhere else. On the same day, Trump had said that he was confident it may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence.

One great way to boost immunity could be to incorporate more healthy food in one‚Äôs diet. What if we tell you that your kitchen condiments can come to your rescue? Here's our quick fix to boost your immunity."

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs comments.

Ramping up its attack against Beijing, the United States has said that there is a ‚Äúsignificant amount of evidence‚Äù that the novel coronavirus, which has infected millions worldwide, emerged from a Chinese laboratory. China, however, accused the Donald Trump-led administration of ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù and sought proof to justify its statement.

Speaking to ABC news on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, ‚ÄúThere is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.‚Äù

Pompeo, however, briefly contradicted the US intelligence agencies‚Äôs conclusion that the virus was neither man-made nor genetically modified.

‚ÄúThe best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,‚Äù he said.

When the interviewer pointed out that was not the conclusion of the intelligence agencies, he backtracked, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they‚Äôve got it wrong.‚Äù

The State Department is yet to issue any clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs remarks.

Responding to Pompeo‚Äôs remarks, China‚Äôs Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party‚Äôs official People‚Äôs Daily, said in an editorial that he did not have any evidence the virus came from the lab in Wuhan and that he was ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù. It also asked the US to provide proof in this regard.

‚ÄúThe Trump administration continues to engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic,‚Äù the editorial said.

The entire Intelligence Community (IC) has been consistently providing critical support to US policymakers and those responding to the virus, which first broke out in China, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2020

‚ÄúThe Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,‚Äù ODNI said giving its assessment about the infection.

Read in Malayalam here

‚ÄúThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,‚Äù it added.

Last week, Pompeo had said it was not known whether the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a meat market, or somewhere else. On the same day, Trump had said that he was confident it may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence.

A 52-year-old woman working at Amma Unavagam (Amma canteen) tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. She was working at the Gajapathy Lala Street branch near Triplicane in Chennai. Amma Unavagam is a scheme run by the government of Tamil Nadu, providing subsidised food.

The woman has been shifted to Omandhurar Government College and Hospital. Following the report, the Amma Unavagam in Icehouse has been shut and all the employees of the branch are being tested.

In April, the Greater Chennai Corporation, which runs over 400 Amma canteens, said it would serve free food during the lockdown. However, after the government announced that hotels and other food services could operate (only parcel services) after May 4 in non-containment areas, the authorities in-charge of Amma Unavagam instructed respective zonal officers to cancel the free food initiative.

On Monday, Amma Unavagams saw a lukewarm response, with people having to shell out from their own pockets for a meal. Migrant laborers and the needy were thriving on the free food of Amma Unavagams.

Meanwhile, Koyembedu wholesale market in Chennai has turned into a Covid-19 hotspot after 107 people, mostly vendors, loaders, and other workers, tested positive in Cuddalore. All of them are linked to the Koyembedu cluster.

So far, 129 positive cases from Cuddalore, 76 from Villupuram, 63 from Chennai, 42 from Ariyalur, seven from Kancheepuram, and one from Perambalur, Thanjavur, and Tiruvarur are linked to the Koyembedu cluster. Massive contact tracing is underway in the state to find out who had visited the place in the last few weeks.

In Tamil Nadu, 3,023 people (2,015 male, 1,007 female, and a transgender) have tested positive for Covid-19. Of the total cases, Chennai accounts for 1,458 cases, about 48 per cent. On May 3 alone 203 people tested positive in the capital city of Tamil Nadu.

There are 1,611 active cases in Tamil Nadu and 1,379 people have been discharged following treatment. A 44-year-old male from Coimbatore who was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Chennai died on Sunday, taking the death toll to 30 in the state.

They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work.‚Äù



Share





The Khans are the high-flying superstars of Indian Airlines Colony in Begumpet, Hyderabad. Even as the entire nation grapples with the novel coronavirus pandemic amid a nationwide lockdown, the Khans are at the forefront of fighting COVID-19, as a family.

On March 3, after several weeks, the three doctors in the Khan family were at home together after a felicitation ceremony where they were showered with rose petals by residents of their colony. ‚ÄúThey are the real heroes. They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work,‚Äù says Gopal Giridhar, a colony resident.

With 22 years of service, Dr Mahboob Khan (56) now works as Superintendent of the Government Chest Hospital which is treating many Covid-19 patients. Despite this, the pulmonologist was overwhelmed by the unprecedented show of support from his neighbours, that too at a time when many doctors across India are facing hostile neighbours. The family has been living in the neighbourhood for the last six years.

‚ÄúYes, we were scared initially as we were dealing with an unknown enemy. Anyone could get infected. There were incidents of medical and health workers contracting the disease and some even lost their lives,‚Äù admits Dr Khan who was part of the team of doctors and experts sent from Telangana to Kerala this February to study the latter‚Äôs experience of dealing with the disease.

Rajender, president of the residents welfare association, is happy that the felicitation was a success. ‚ÄúWe did not have enough time and in the short notice, we could mobilise so many people. This means that our people would come out for a good cause even in times of a pandemic,‚Äù he says, adding that they took special care in ensuring people maintain social distance during the small event.

Telangana recorded its first active case on March 1 and by the third week there was a sudden surge in the number of positive cases after 10 Indonesian nationals who reached Karimnagar after participating in the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi were tested positive for the disease.

As of May 3, Telangana has had 1,082 positive cases. As many as 545 of them have been discharged and sent to home quarantine. There are 508 active cases in hospitals, whereas 29 have succumbed.

Dr Khan‚Äôs 48-year-old wife Dr Shahana Khan works at the Gandhi Hospital where their daughter Dr Rashika Khan (22) is a house surgeon. Gandhi hospital, the nodal centre for treating COVID-19 in the state, treated almost 90 per cent of the total 545 patients cured of the disease so far.

The trio has seen hundreds of patients now. But is the daily stress of taking on this unknown enemy, tiring Dr Khan out? ‚ÄúNo way. Dealing with the disease requires us to constantly update ourselves. The appreciation and encouragement keeps us going,‚Äù he says.

However, as an administrator, he agrees, the last month has been stressful. Many a time, when the doctors or health workers found themselves in doubt, it was up to the administrative head to keep the flock together. Taking the medical and health community together with conviction, motivating them, and boosting their morale was a challenge initially.

‚ÄúI say time is the best medicine,‚Äù he says, pointing out that there was panic among doctors, health workers, patients, and the society. Health workers were asked to stay away from their homes and localities. Now the same society appreciates their work, he says. This, according to him, is because of the high recovery rates of patients.

Covid-19 has become part of their lives and is the most common topic of discussion at their dinner table, adds Dr Shahana. ‚ÄúI have to take care of our home too. I cannot neglect the family and patients are equally in need of us. So we do not hesitate to discuss Covid-19 at home and that helps,‚Äù she says.

With no domestic help available, Dr Shahana says her work at home has only doubled. She points at her mother, 72-year-old Azimunnisa Begum, who stays with them. ‚ÄúEspecially now, she needs more care. She is diabetic and has hypertension,‚Äù she adds.

Meanwhile, relatives and friends are worried for the family‚Äôs well-being. The family is flooded with phone calls from relatives across the country. Friends, too, keep checking on them. ‚ÄúThey appreciate our work and say they are proud of us. That is great to hear,‚Äù adds Dr Khan.

For the youngest doctor in the family, it was almost a baptism by fire. Dr Rashika had always wanted to become a doctor like her parents. ‚ÄúBut I never expected my internship to start this way. From Day One, everyone is posted in COVID duty,‚Äù says Rashika, who completed her MBBS just recently. For house surgeons like her, this has been a scary experience as none of them knew anything about the disease. ‚ÄúWith all the guidance from our seniors, all of us interns are now doing a good job and no one would believe we are fresh interns,‚Äù she adds.

Rashika‚Äôs younger brother Rehaan (18) is also a doctor in waiting, says the family, adding how they are currently preparing for the upcoming NEET exam. Having three corona warriors at home has inspired him further. ‚ÄúI just remind myself that I have three family members fighting a huge pandemic. This pushes me to achieve my goal,‚Äù says Rehaan.

To all those who fear contracting Covid-19, Dr Khan says there is nothing to worry about. The government and the health department are closely monitoring the developments and the citizens need to merely follow the instructions and stay at home, he emphasises. ‚ÄúThis may continue for another month and it might take six to seven months for the disease to vanish. But the same situation may not prevail. It is the responsibility of the public to help fight the virus by staying at home,‚Äù he adds.

For house surgeons like her, this has been a scary experience as none of them knew anything about the disease. ‚ÄúWith all the guidance from our seniors, all of us interns are now doing a good job and no one would believe we are fresh interns,‚Äù she adds.

Rashika‚Äôs younger brother Rehaan (18) is also a doctor in waiting, says the family, adding how they are currently preparing for the upcoming NEET exam. Having three corona warriors at home has inspired him further. ‚ÄúI just remind myself that I have three family members fighting a huge pandemic. This pushes me to achieve my goal,‚Äù says Rehaan.

To all those who fear contracting Covid-19, Dr Khan says there is nothing to worry about. The government and the health department are closely monitoring the developments and the citizens need to merely follow the instructions and stay at home, he emphasises. ‚ÄúThis may continue for another month and it might take six to seven months for the disease to vanish. But the same situation may not prevail. It is the responsibility of the public to help fight the virus by staying at home,‚Äù he adds.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs comments.

Ramping up its attack against Beijing, the United States has said that there is a ‚Äúsignificant amount of evidence‚Äù that the novel coronavirus, which has infected millions worldwide, emerged from a Chinese laboratory. China, however, accused the Donald Trump-led administration of ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù and sought proof to justify its statement.

Speaking to ABC news on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, ‚ÄúThere is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.‚Äù

Pompeo, however, briefly contradicted the US intelligence agencies‚Äôs conclusion that the virus was neither man-made nor genetically modified.

‚ÄúThe best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,‚Äù he said.

When the interviewer pointed out that was not the conclusion of the intelligence agencies, he backtracked, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they‚Äôve got it wrong.‚Äù

The State Department is yet to issue any clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs remarks.

Responding to Pompeo‚Äôs remarks, China‚Äôs Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party‚Äôs official People‚Äôs Daily, said in an editorial that he did not have any evidence the virus came from the lab in Wuhan and that he was ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù. It also asked the US to provide proof in this regard.

‚ÄúThe Trump administration continues to engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic,‚Äù the editorial said.

The entire Intelligence Community (IC) has been consistently providing critical support to US policymakers and those responding to the virus, which first broke out in China, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2020

‚ÄúThe Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,‚Äù ODNI said giving its assessment about the infection.

Read in Malayalam here

‚ÄúThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,‚Äù it added.

Last week, Pompeo had said it was not known whether the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a meat market, or somewhere else. On the same day, Trump had said that he was confident it may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence.

A 52-year-old woman working at Amma Unavagam (Amma canteen) tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. She was working at the Gajapathy Lala Street branch near Triplicane in Chennai. Amma Unavagam is a scheme run by the government of Tamil Nadu, providing subsidised food.

The woman has been shifted to Omandhurar Government College and Hospital. Following the report, the Amma Unavagam in Icehouse has been shut and all the employees of the branch are being tested.

In April, the Greater Chennai Corporation, which runs over 400 Amma canteens, said it would serve free food during the lockdown. However, after the government announced that hotels and other food services could operate (only parcel services) after May 4 in non-containment areas, the authorities in-charge of Amma Unavagam instructed respective zonal officers to cancel the free food initiative.

On Monday, Amma Unavagams saw a lukewarm response, with people having to shell out from their own pockets for a meal. Migrant laborers and the needy were thriving on the free food of Amma Unavagams.

Meanwhile, Koyembedu wholesale market in Chennai has turned into a Covid-19 hotspot after 107 people, mostly vendors, loaders, and other workers, tested positive in Cuddalore. All of them are linked to the Koyembedu cluster.

So far, 129 positive cases from Cuddalore, 76 from Villupuram, 63 from Chennai, 42 from Ariyalur, seven from Kancheepuram, and one from Perambalur, Thanjavur, and Tiruvarur are linked to the Koyembedu cluster. Massive contact tracing is underway in the state to find out who had visited the place in the last few weeks.

In Tamil Nadu, 3,023 people (2,015 male, 1,007 female, and a transgender) have tested positive for Covid-19. Of the total cases, Chennai accounts for 1,458 cases, about 48 per cent. On May 3 alone 203 people tested positive in the capital city of Tamil Nadu.

There are 1,611 active cases in Tamil Nadu and 1,379 people have been discharged following treatment. A 44-year-old male from Coimbatore who was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Chennai died on Sunday, taking the death toll to 30 in the state.

They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work.‚Äù



Share





The Khans are the high-flying superstars of Indian Airlines Colony in Begumpet, Hyderabad. Even as the entire nation grapples with the novel coronavirus pandemic amid a nationwide lockdown, the Khans are at the forefront of fighting COVID-19, as a family.

On March 3, after several weeks, the three doctors in the Khan family were at home together after a felicitation ceremony where they were showered with rose petals by residents of their colony. ‚ÄúThey are the real heroes. They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work,‚Äù says Gopal Giridhar, a colony resident.

With 22 years of service, Dr Mahboob Khan (56) now works as Superintendent of the Government Chest Hospital which is treating many Covid-19 patients. Despite this, the pulmonologist was overwhelmed by the unprecedented show of support from his neighbours, that too at a time when many doctors across India are facing hostile neighbours. The family has been living in the neighbourhood for the last six years.

‚ÄúYes, we were scared initially as we were dealing with an unknown enemy. Anyone could get infected. There were incidents of medical and health workers contracting the disease and some even lost their lives,‚Äù admits Dr Khan who was part of the team of doctors and experts sent from Telangana to Kerala this February to study the latter‚Äôs experience of dealing with the disease.

Rajender, president of the residents welfare association, is happy that the felicitation was a success. ‚ÄúWe did not have enough time and in the short notice, we could mobilise so many people. This means that our people would come out for a good cause even in times of a pandemic,‚Äù he says, adding that they took special care in ensuring people maintain social distance during the small event.

Telangana recorded its first active case on March 1 and by the third week there was a sudden surge in the number of positive cases after 10 Indonesian nationals who reached Karimnagar after participating in the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi were tested positive for the disease.

As of May 3, Telangana has had 1,082 positive cases. As many as 545 of them have been discharged and sent to home quarantine. There are 508 active cases in hospitals, whereas 29 have succumbed.

Dr Khan‚Äôs 48-year-old wife Dr Shahana Khan works at the Gandhi Hospital where their daughter Dr Rashika Khan (22) is a house surgeon. Gandhi hospital, the nodal centre for treating COVID-19 in the state, treated almost 90 per cent of the total 545 patients cured of the disease so far.

The trio has seen hundreds of patients now. But is the daily stress of taking on this unknown enemy, tiring Dr Khan out? ‚ÄúNo way. Dealing with the disease requires us to constantly update ourselves. The appreciation and encouragement keeps us going,‚Äù he says.

However, as an administrator, he agrees, the last month has been stressful. Many a time, when the doctors or health workers found themselves in doubt, it was up to the administrative head to keep the flock together. Taking the medical and health community together with conviction, motivating them, and boosting their morale was a challenge initially.

‚ÄúI say time is the best medicine,‚Äù he says, pointing out that there was panic among doctors, health workers, patients, and the society. Health workers were asked to stay away from their homes and localities. Now the same society appreciates their work, he says. This, according to him, is because of the high recovery rates of patients.

Covid-19 has become part of their lives and is the most common topic of discussion at their dinner table, adds Dr Shahana. ‚ÄúI have to take care of our home too. I cannot neglect the family and patients are equally in need of us. So we do not hesitate to discuss Covid-19 at home and that helps,‚Äù she says.

With no domestic help available, Dr Shahana says her work at home has only doubled. She points at her mother, 72-year-old Azimunnisa Begum, who stays with them. ‚ÄúEspecially now, she needs more care. She is diabetic and has hypertension,‚Äù she adds.

Meanwhile, relatives and friends are worried for the family‚Äôs well-being. The family is flooded with phone calls from relatives across the country. Friends, too, keep checking on them. ‚ÄúThey appreciate our work and say they are proud of us. That is great to hear,‚Äù adds Dr Khan.

They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work.‚Äù

The Khans are the high-flying superstars of Indian Airlines Colony in Begumpet, Hyderabad. Even as the entire nation grapples with the novel coronavirus pandemic amid a nationwide lockdown, the Khans are at the forefront of fighting COVID-19, as a family.

On March 3, after several weeks, the three doctors in the Khan family were at home together after a felicitation ceremony where they were showered with rose petals by residents of their colony. ‚ÄúThey are the real heroes. They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work,‚Äù says Gopal Giridhar, a colony resident.

With 22 years of service, Dr Mahboob Khan (56) now works as Superintendent of the Government Chest Hospital which is treating many Covid-19 patients. Despite this, the pulmonologist was overwhelmed by the unprecedented show of support from his neighbours, that too at a time when many doctors across India are facing hostile neighbours. The family has been living in the neighbourhood for the last six years.

‚ÄúYes, we were scared initially as we were dealing with an unknown enemy. Anyone could get infected. There were incidents of medical and health workers contracting the disease and some even lost their lives,‚Äù admits Dr Khan who was part of the team of doctors and experts sent from Telangana to Kerala this February to study the latter‚Äôs experience of dealing with the disease.

Rajender, president of the residents welfare association, is happy that the felicitation was a success. ‚ÄúWe did not have enough time and in the short notice, we could mobilise so many people. This means that our people would come out for a good cause even in times of a pandemic,‚Äù he says, adding that they took special care in ensuring people maintain social distance during the small event.

Telangana recorded its first active case on March 1 and by the third week there was a sudden surge in the number of positive cases after 10 Indonesian nationals who reached Karimnagar after participating in the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi were tested positive for the disease.

As of May 3, Telangana has had 1,082 positive cases. As many as 545 of them have been discharged and sent to home quarantine. There are 508 active cases in hospitals, whereas 29 have succumbed.

Dr Khan‚Äôs 48-year-old wife Dr Shahana Khan works at the Gandhi Hospital where their daughter Dr Rashika Khan (22) is a house surgeon. Gandhi hospital, the nodal centre for treating COVID-19 in the state, treated almost 90 per cent of the total 545 patients cured of the disease so far.

The trio has seen hundreds of patients now. But is the daily stress of taking on this unknown enemy, tiring Dr Khan out? ‚ÄúNo way. Dealing with the disease requires us to constantly update ourselves. The appreciation and encouragement keeps us going,‚Äù he says.

However, as an administrator, he agrees, the last month has been stressful. Many a time, when the doctors or health workers found themselves in doubt, it was up to the administrative head to keep the flock together. Taking the medical and health community together with conviction, motivating them, and boosting their morale was a challenge initially.

‚ÄúI say time is the best medicine,‚Äù he says, pointing out that there was panic among doctors, health workers, patients, and the society. Health workers were asked to stay away from their homes and localities. Now the same society appreciates their work, he says. This, according to him, is because of the high recovery rates of patients.

Covid-19 has become part of their lives and is the most common topic of discussion at their dinner table, adds Dr Shahana. ‚ÄúI have to take care of our home too. I cannot neglect the family and patients are equally in need of us. So we do not hesitate to discuss Covid-19 at home and that helps,‚Äù she says.

With no domestic help available, Dr Shahana says her work at home has only doubled. She points at her mother, 72-year-old Azimunnisa Begum, who stays with them. ‚ÄúEspecially now, she needs more care. She is diabetic and has hypertension,‚Äù she adds.

Meanwhile, relatives and friends are worried for the family‚Äôs well-being. The family is flooded with phone calls from relatives across the country. Friends, too, keep checking on them. ‚ÄúThey appreciate our work and say they are proud of us. That is great to hear,‚Äù adds Dr Khan.

For the youngest doctor in the family, it was almost a baptism by fire. Dr Rashika had always wanted to become a doctor like her parents. ‚ÄúBut I never expected my internship to start this way. From Day One, everyone is posted in COVID duty,‚Äù says Rashika, who completed her MBBS just recently. For house surgeons like her, this has been a scary experience as none of them knew anything about the disease. ‚ÄúWith all the guidance from our seniors, all of us interns are now doing a good job and no one would believe we are fresh interns,‚Äù she adds.

Rashika‚Äôs younger brother Rehaan (18) is also a doctor in waiting, says the family, adding how they are currently preparing for the upcoming NEET exam. Having three corona warriors at home has inspired him further. ‚ÄúI just remind myself that I have three family members fighting a huge pandemic. This pushes me to achieve my goal,‚Äù says Rehaan.

To all those who fear contracting Covid-19, Dr Khan says there is nothing to worry about. The government and the health department are closely monitoring the developments and the citizens need to merely follow the instructions and stay at home, he emphasises. ‚ÄúThis may continue for another month and it might take six to seven months for the disease to vanish. But the same situation may not prevail. It is the responsibility of the public to help fight the virus by staying at home,‚Äù he adds.

https://indianexpress.com/article/world/significant-evidence-that-coronavirus-emerged-from-wuhan-lab-mike-pompeo-6392667/,"The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs comments. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs comments.

Ramping up its attack against Beijing, the United States has said that there is a ‚Äúsignificant amount of evidence‚Äù that the novel coronavirus, which has infected millions worldwide, emerged from a Chinese laboratory. China, however, accused the Donald Trump-led administration of ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù and sought proof to justify its statement.

Speaking to ABC news on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, ‚ÄúThere is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.‚Äù

Pompeo, however, briefly contradicted the US intelligence agencies‚Äôs conclusion that the virus was neither man-made nor genetically modified.

‚ÄúThe best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,‚Äù he said.

When the interviewer pointed out that was not the conclusion of the intelligence agencies, he backtracked, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they‚Äôve got it wrong.‚Äù

The State Department is yet to issue any clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs remarks.

Responding to Pompeo‚Äôs remarks, China‚Äôs Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party‚Äôs official People‚Äôs Daily, said in an editorial that he did not have any evidence the virus came from the lab in Wuhan and that he was ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù. It also asked the US to provide proof in this regard.

‚ÄúThe Trump administration continues to engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic,‚Äù the editorial said.

The entire Intelligence Community (IC) has been consistently providing critical support to US policymakers and those responding to the virus, which first broke out in China, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2020

‚ÄúThe Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,‚Äù ODNI said giving its assessment about the infection.

Read in Malayalam here

‚ÄúThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,‚Äù it added.

Last week, Pompeo had said it was not known whether the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a meat market, or somewhere else. On the same day, Trump had said that he was confident it may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence.

A 52-year-old woman working at Amma Unavagam (Amma canteen) tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. She was working at the Gajapathy Lala Street branch near Triplicane in Chennai. Amma Unavagam is a scheme run by the government of Tamil Nadu, providing subsidised food.

The woman has been shifted to Omandhurar Government College and Hospital. Following the report, the Amma Unavagam in Icehouse has been shut and all the employees of the branch are being tested.

In April, the Greater Chennai Corporation, which runs over 400 Amma canteens, said it would serve free food during the lockdown. However, after the government announced that hotels and other food services could operate (only parcel services) after May 4 in non-containment areas, the authorities in-charge of Amma Unavagam instructed respective zonal officers to cancel the free food initiative.

On Monday, Amma Unavagams saw a lukewarm response, with people having to shell out from their own pockets for a meal. Migrant laborers and the needy were thriving on the free food of Amma Unavagams.

Meanwhile, Koyembedu wholesale market in Chennai has turned into a Covid-19 hotspot after 107 people, mostly vendors, loaders, and other workers, tested positive in Cuddalore. All of them are linked to the Koyembedu cluster.

So far, 129 positive cases from Cuddalore, 76 from Villupuram, 63 from Chennai, 42 from Ariyalur, seven from Kancheepuram, and one from Perambalur, Thanjavur, and Tiruvarur are linked to the Koyembedu cluster. Massive contact tracing is underway in the state to find out who had visited the place in the last few weeks.

In Tamil Nadu, 3,023 people (2,015 male, 1,007 female, and a transgender) have tested positive for Covid-19. Of the total cases, Chennai accounts for 1,458 cases, about 48 per cent. On May 3 alone 203 people tested positive in the capital city of Tamil Nadu.

There are 1,611 active cases in Tamil Nadu and 1,379 people have been discharged following treatment. A 44-year-old male from Coimbatore who was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Chennai died on Sunday, taking the death toll to 30 in the state.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs comments.

Ramping up its attack against Beijing, the United States has said that there is a ‚Äúsignificant amount of evidence‚Äù that the novel coronavirus, which has infected millions worldwide, emerged from a Chinese laboratory. China, however, accused the Donald Trump-led administration of ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù and sought proof to justify its statement.

Speaking to ABC news on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, ‚ÄúThere is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.‚Äù

Pompeo, however, briefly contradicted the US intelligence agencies‚Äôs conclusion that the virus was neither man-made nor genetically modified.

‚ÄúThe best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,‚Äù he said.

When the interviewer pointed out that was not the conclusion of the intelligence agencies, he backtracked, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they‚Äôve got it wrong.‚Äù

The State Department is yet to issue any clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs remarks.

Responding to Pompeo‚Äôs remarks, China‚Äôs Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party‚Äôs official People‚Äôs Daily, said in an editorial that he did not have any evidence the virus came from the lab in Wuhan and that he was ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù. It also asked the US to provide proof in this regard.

‚ÄúThe Trump administration continues to engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic,‚Äù the editorial said.

The entire Intelligence Community (IC) has been consistently providing critical support to US policymakers and those responding to the virus, which first broke out in China, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2020

‚ÄúThe Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,‚Äù ODNI said giving its assessment about the infection.

‚ÄúThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,‚Äù it added.

Last week, Pompeo had said it was not known whether the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a meat market, or somewhere else. On the same day, Trump had said that he was confident it may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence.

A 52-year-old woman working at Amma Unavagam (Amma canteen) tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. She was working at the Gajapathy Lala Street branch near Triplicane in Chennai. Amma Unavagam is a scheme run by the government of Tamil Nadu, providing subsidised food.

The woman has been shifted to Omandhurar Government College and Hospital. Following the report, the Amma Unavagam in Icehouse has been shut and all the employees of the branch are being tested.

In April, the Greater Chennai Corporation, which runs over 400 Amma canteens, said it would serve free food during the lockdown. However, after the government announced that hotels and other food services could operate (only parcel services) after May 4 in non-containment areas, the authorities in-charge of Amma Unavagam instructed respective zonal officers to cancel the free food initiative.

On Monday, Amma Unavagams saw a lukewarm response, with people having to shell out from their own pockets for a meal. Migrant laborers and the needy were thriving on the free food of Amma Unavagams.

Meanwhile, Koyembedu wholesale market in Chennai has turned into a Covid-19 hotspot after 107 people, mostly vendors, loaders, and other workers, tested positive in Cuddalore. All of them are linked to the Koyembedu cluster.

So far, 129 positive cases from Cuddalore, 76 from Villupuram, 63 from Chennai, 42 from Ariyalur, seven from Kancheepuram, and one from Perambalur, Thanjavur, and Tiruvarur are linked to the Koyembedu cluster. Massive contact tracing is underway in the state to find out who had visited the place in the last few weeks.

In Tamil Nadu, 3,023 people (2,015 male, 1,007 female, and a transgender) have tested positive for Covid-19. Of the total cases, Chennai accounts for 1,458 cases, about 48 per cent. On May 3 alone 203 people tested positive in the capital city of Tamil Nadu.

There are 1,611 active cases in Tamil Nadu and 1,379 people have been discharged following treatment. A 44-year-old male from Coimbatore who was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Chennai died on Sunday, taking the death toll to 30 in the state.

They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work.‚Äù



Share





The Khans are the high-flying superstars of Indian Airlines Colony in Begumpet, Hyderabad. Even as the entire nation grapples with the novel coronavirus pandemic amid a nationwide lockdown, the Khans are at the forefront of fighting COVID-19, as a family.

On March 3, after several weeks, the three doctors in the Khan family were at home together after a felicitation ceremony where they were showered with rose petals by residents of their colony. ‚ÄúThey are the real heroes. They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work,‚Äù says Gopal Giridhar, a colony resident.

With 22 years of service, Dr Mahboob Khan (56) now works as Superintendent of the Government Chest Hospital which is treating many Covid-19 patients. Despite this, the pulmonologist was overwhelmed by the unprecedented show of support from his neighbours, that too at a time when many doctors across India are facing hostile neighbours. The family has been living in the neighbourhood for the last six years.

‚ÄúYes, we were scared initially as we were dealing with an unknown enemy. Anyone could get infected. There were incidents of medical and health workers contracting the disease and some even lost their lives,‚Äù admits Dr Khan who was part of the team of doctors and experts sent from Telangana to Kerala this February to study the latter‚Äôs experience of dealing with the disease.

Rajender, president of the residents welfare association, is happy that the felicitation was a success. ‚ÄúWe did not have enough time and in the short notice, we could mobilise so many people. This means that our people would come out for a good cause even in times of a pandemic,‚Äù he says, adding that they took special care in ensuring people maintain social distance during the small event.

Telangana recorded its first active case on March 1 and by the third week there was a sudden surge in the number of positive cases after 10 Indonesian nationals who reached Karimnagar after participating in the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi were tested positive for the disease.

As of May 3, Telangana has had 1,082 positive cases. As many as 545 of them have been discharged and sent to home quarantine. There are 508 active cases in hospitals, whereas 29 have succumbed.

Dr Khan‚Äôs 48-year-old wife Dr Shahana Khan works at the Gandhi Hospital where their daughter Dr Rashika Khan (22) is a house surgeon. Gandhi hospital, the nodal centre for treating COVID-19 in the state, treated almost 90 per cent of the total 545 patients cured of the disease so far.

The trio has seen hundreds of patients now. But is the daily stress of taking on this unknown enemy, tiring Dr Khan out? ‚ÄúNo way. Dealing with the disease requires us to constantly update ourselves. The appreciation and encouragement keeps us going,‚Äù he says.

However, as an administrator, he agrees, the last month has been stressful. Many a time, when the doctors or health workers found themselves in doubt, it was up to the administrative head to keep the flock together. Taking the medical and health community together with conviction, motivating them, and boosting their morale was a challenge initially.

‚ÄúI say time is the best medicine,‚Äù he says, pointing out that there was panic among doctors, health workers, patients, and the society. Health workers were asked to stay away from their homes and localities. Now the same society appreciates their work, he says. This, according to him, is because of the high recovery rates of patients.

Covid-19 has become part of their lives and is the most common topic of discussion at their dinner table, adds Dr Shahana. ‚ÄúI have to take care of our home too. I cannot neglect the family and patients are equally in need of us. So we do not hesitate to discuss Covid-19 at home and that helps,‚Äù she says.

With no domestic help available, Dr Shahana says her work at home has only doubled. She points at her mother, 72-year-old Azimunnisa Begum, who stays with them. ‚ÄúEspecially now, she needs more care. She is diabetic and has hypertension,‚Äù she adds.

Meanwhile, relatives and friends are worried for the family‚Äôs well-being. The family is flooded with phone calls from relatives across the country. Friends, too, keep checking on them. ‚ÄúThey appreciate our work and say they are proud of us. That is great to hear,‚Äù adds Dr Khan.

For the youngest doctor in the family, it was almost a baptism by fire. Dr Rashika had always wanted to become a doctor like her parents. ‚ÄúBut I never expected my internship to start this way. From Day One, everyone is posted in COVID duty,‚Äù says Rashika, who completed her MBBS just recently. For house surgeons like her, this has been a scary experience as none of them knew anything about the disease. ‚ÄúWith all the guidance from our seniors, all of us interns are now doing a good job and no one would believe we are fresh interns,‚Äù she adds.

Rashika‚Äôs younger brother Rehaan (18) is also a doctor in waiting, says the family, adding how they are currently preparing for the upcoming NEET exam. Having three corona warriors at home has inspired him further. ‚ÄúI just remind myself that I have three family members fighting a huge pandemic. This pushes me to achieve my goal,‚Äù says Rehaan.

To all those who fear contracting Covid-19, Dr Khan says there is nothing to worry about. The government and the health department are closely monitoring the developments and the citizens need to merely follow the instructions and stay at home, he emphasises. ‚ÄúThis may continue for another month and it might take six to seven months for the disease to vanish. But the same situation may not prevail. It is the responsibility of the public to help fight the virus by staying at home,‚Äù he adds.

‚ÄúThanks for the contribution‚Ä¶ Thank you all @Asli_Jacqueline @IuliaVantur @Iamrahulkanal @imKamaalKhan @NiketanMadhok @Iamwaluscha #AbhirajMinawala,‚Äù Salman wrote along with an Instagram video of celebrities putting supplies on carts and tractors.

Salman Khan is stuck at his Panvel farmhouse ever since the national lockdown was announced in March. He has been sharing videos on social media applauding frontline workers and urging fans to practice social distancing.

In March, the superstar pledged to support 25,000 daily wage workers of the Federation of Western India Cine Employees (FWICE), whose livelihood has been severely affected.

Salman Khan even released a song titled ‚ÄúPyaar Karona‚Äù, apart from helping Bollywood paparazzi who are currently out of work.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs comments.

Ramping up its attack against Beijing, the United States has said that there is a ‚Äúsignificant amount of evidence‚Äù that the novel coronavirus, which has infected millions worldwide, emerged from a Chinese laboratory. China, however, accused the Donald Trump-led administration of ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù and sought proof to justify its statement.

Speaking to ABC news on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, ‚ÄúThere is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.‚Äù

Pompeo, however, briefly contradicted the US intelligence agencies‚Äôs conclusion that the virus was neither man-made nor genetically modified.

‚ÄúThe best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,‚Äù he said.

When the interviewer pointed out that was not the conclusion of the intelligence agencies, he backtracked, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they‚Äôve got it wrong.‚Äù

The State Department is yet to issue any clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs remarks.

Responding to Pompeo‚Äôs remarks, China‚Äôs Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party‚Äôs official People‚Äôs Daily, said in an editorial that he did not have any evidence the virus came from the lab in Wuhan and that he was ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù. It also asked the US to provide proof in this regard.

‚ÄúThe Trump administration continues to engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic,‚Äù the editorial said.

The entire Intelligence Community (IC) has been consistently providing critical support to US policymakers and those responding to the virus, which first broke out in China, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2020

‚ÄúThe Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,‚Äù ODNI said giving its assessment about the infection.

Read in Malayalam here

‚ÄúThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,‚Äù it added.

Last week, Pompeo had said it was not known whether the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a meat market, or somewhere else. On the same day, Trump had said that he was confident it may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence.

A 52-year-old woman working at Amma Unavagam (Amma canteen) tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. She was working at the Gajapathy Lala Street branch near Triplicane in Chennai. Amma Unavagam is a scheme run by the government of Tamil Nadu, providing subsidised food.

The woman has been shifted to Omandhurar Government College and Hospital. Following the report, the Amma Unavagam in Icehouse has been shut and all the employees of the branch are being tested.

In April, the Greater Chennai Corporation, which runs over 400 Amma canteens, said it would serve free food during the lockdown. However, after the government announced that hotels and other food services could operate (only parcel services) after May 4 in non-containment areas, the authorities in-charge of Amma Unavagam instructed respective zonal officers to cancel the free food initiative.

On Monday, Amma Unavagams saw a lukewarm response, with people having to shell out from their own pockets for a meal. Migrant laborers and the needy were thriving on the free food of Amma Unavagams.

Meanwhile, Koyembedu wholesale market in Chennai has turned into a Covid-19 hotspot after 107 people, mostly vendors, loaders, and other workers, tested positive in Cuddalore. All of them are linked to the Koyembedu cluster.

So far, 129 positive cases from Cuddalore, 76 from Villupuram, 63 from Chennai, 42 from Ariyalur, seven from Kancheepuram, and one from Perambalur, Thanjavur, and Tiruvarur are linked to the Koyembedu cluster. Massive contact tracing is underway in the state to find out who had visited the place in the last few weeks.

In Tamil Nadu, 3,023 people (2,015 male, 1,007 female, and a transgender) have tested positive for Covid-19. Of the total cases, Chennai accounts for 1,458 cases, about 48 per cent. On May 3 alone 203 people tested positive in the capital city of Tamil Nadu.

There are 1,611 active cases in Tamil Nadu and 1,379 people have been discharged following treatment. A 44-year-old male from Coimbatore who was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Chennai died on Sunday, taking the death toll to 30 in the state.

They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work.‚Äù



Share





The Khans are the high-flying superstars of Indian Airlines Colony in Begumpet, Hyderabad. Even as the entire nation grapples with the novel coronavirus pandemic amid a nationwide lockdown, the Khans are at the forefront of fighting COVID-19, as a family.

On March 3, after several weeks, the three doctors in the Khan family were at home together after a felicitation ceremony where they were showered with rose petals by residents of their colony. ‚ÄúThey are the real heroes. They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work,‚Äù says Gopal Giridhar, a colony resident.

With 22 years of service, Dr Mahboob Khan (56) now works as Superintendent of the Government Chest Hospital which is treating many Covid-19 patients. Despite this, the pulmonologist was overwhelmed by the unprecedented show of support from his neighbours, that too at a time when many doctors across India are facing hostile neighbours. The family has been living in the neighbourhood for the last six years.

‚ÄúYes, we were scared initially as we were dealing with an unknown enemy. Anyone could get infected. There were incidents of medical and health workers contracting the disease and some even lost their lives,‚Äù admits Dr Khan who was part of the team of doctors and experts sent from Telangana to Kerala this February to study the latter‚Äôs experience of dealing with the disease.

Rajender, president of the residents welfare association, is happy that the felicitation was a success. ‚ÄúWe did not have enough time and in the short notice, we could mobilise so many people. This means that our people would come out for a good cause even in times of a pandemic,‚Äù he says, adding that they took special care in ensuring people maintain social distance during the small event.

Telangana recorded its first active case on March 1 and by the third week there was a sudden surge in the number of positive cases after 10 Indonesian nationals who reached Karimnagar after participating in the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi were tested positive for the disease.

As of May 3, Telangana has had 1,082 positive cases. As many as 545 of them have been discharged and sent to home quarantine. There are 508 active cases in hospitals, whereas 29 have succumbed.

Dr Khan‚Äôs 48-year-old wife Dr Shahana Khan works at the Gandhi Hospital where their daughter Dr Rashika Khan (22) is a house surgeon. Gandhi hospital, the nodal centre for treating COVID-19 in the state, treated almost 90 per cent of the total 545 patients cured of the disease so far.

The trio has seen hundreds of patients now. But is the daily stress of taking on this unknown enemy, tiring Dr Khan out? ‚ÄúNo way. Dealing with the disease requires us to constantly update ourselves. The appreciation and encouragement keeps us going,‚Äù he says.

However, as an administrator, he agrees, the last month has been stressful. Many a time, when the doctors or health workers found themselves in doubt, it was up to the administrative head to keep the flock together. Taking the medical and health community together with conviction, motivating them, and boosting their morale was a challenge initially.

‚ÄúI say time is the best medicine,‚Äù he says, pointing out that there was panic among doctors, health workers, patients, and the society. Health workers were asked to stay away from their homes and localities. Now the same society appreciates their work, he says. This, according to him, is because of the high recovery rates of patients.

Covid-19 has become part of their lives and is the most common topic of discussion at their dinner table, adds Dr Shahana. ‚ÄúI have to take care of our home too. I cannot neglect the family and patients are equally in need of us. So we do not hesitate to discuss Covid-19 at home and that helps,‚Äù she says.

With no domestic help available, Dr Shahana says her work at home has only doubled. She points at her mother, 72-year-old Azimunnisa Begum, who stays with them. ‚ÄúEspecially now, she needs more care. She is diabetic and has hypertension,‚Äù she adds.

Meanwhile, relatives and friends are worried for the family‚Äôs well-being. The family is flooded with phone calls from relatives across the country. Friends, too, keep checking on them. ‚ÄúThey appreciate our work and say they are proud of us. That is great to hear,‚Äù adds Dr Khan.

For the youngest doctor in the family, it was almost a baptism by fire. Dr Rashika had always wanted to become a doctor like her parents. ‚ÄúBut I never expected my internship to start this way. From Day One, everyone is posted in COVID duty,‚Äù says Rashika, who completed her MBBS just recently. For house surgeons like her, this has been a scary experience as none of them knew anything about the disease. ‚ÄúWith all the guidance from our seniors, all of us interns are now doing a good job and no one would believe we are fresh interns,‚Äù she adds.

Rashika‚Äôs younger brother Rehaan (18) is also a doctor in waiting, says the family, adding how they are currently preparing for the upcoming NEET exam. Having three corona warriors at home has inspired him further. ‚ÄúI just remind myself that I have three family members fighting a huge pandemic. This pushes me to achieve my goal,‚Äù says Rehaan.

To all those who fear contracting Covid-19, Dr Khan says there is nothing to worry about. The government and the health department are closely monitoring the developments and the citizens need to merely follow the instructions and stay at home, he emphasises. ‚ÄúThis may continue for another month and it might take six to seven months for the disease to vanish. But the same situation may not prevail. It is the responsibility of the public to help fight the virus by staying at home,‚Äù he adds.

Rajender, president of the residents welfare association, is happy that the felicitation was a success. ‚ÄúWe did not have enough time and in the short notice, we could mobilise so many people. This means that our people would come out for a good cause even in times of a pandemic,‚Äù he says, adding that they took special care in ensuring people maintain social distance during the small event.

Telangana recorded its first active case on March 1 and by the third week there was a sudden surge in the number of positive cases after 10 Indonesian nationals who reached Karimnagar after participating in the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi were tested positive for the disease.

As of May 3, Telangana has had 1,082 positive cases. As many as 545 of them have been discharged and sent to home quarantine. There are 508 active cases in hospitals, whereas 29 have succumbed.

Dr Khan‚Äôs 48-year-old wife Dr Shahana Khan works at the Gandhi Hospital where their daughter Dr Rashika Khan (22) is a house surgeon. Gandhi hospital, the nodal centre for treating COVID-19 in the state, treated almost 90 per cent of the total 545 patients cured of the disease so far.

The trio has seen hundreds of patients now. But is the daily stress of taking on this unknown enemy, tiring Dr Khan out? ‚ÄúNo way. Dealing with the disease requires us to constantly update ourselves. The appreciation and encouragement keeps us going,‚Äù he says.

However, as an administrator, he agrees, the last month has been stressful. Many a time, when the doctors or health workers found themselves in doubt, it was up to the administrative head to keep the flock together. Taking the medical and health community together with conviction, motivating them, and boosting their morale was a challenge initially.

‚ÄúI say time is the best medicine,‚Äù he says, pointing out that there was panic among doctors, health workers, patients, and the society. Health workers were asked to stay away from their homes and localities. Now the same society appreciates their work, he says. This, according to him, is because of the high recovery rates of patients.

Covid-19 has become part of their lives and is the most common topic of discussion at their dinner table, adds Dr Shahana. ‚ÄúI have to take care of our home too. I cannot neglect the family and patients are equally in need of us. So we do not hesitate to discuss Covid-19 at home and that helps,‚Äù she says.

With no domestic help available, Dr Shahana says her work at home has only doubled. She points at her mother, 72-year-old Azimunnisa Begum, who stays with them. ‚ÄúEspecially now, she needs more care. She is diabetic and has hypertension,‚Äù she adds.

Meanwhile, relatives and friends are worried for the family‚Äôs well-being. The family is flooded with phone calls from relatives across the country. Friends, too, keep checking on them. ‚ÄúThey appreciate our work and say they are proud of us. That is great to hear,‚Äù adds Dr Khan.

For the youngest doctor in the family, it was almost a baptism by fire. Dr Rashika had always wanted to become a doctor like her parents. ‚ÄúBut I never expected my internship to start this way. From Day One, everyone is posted in COVID duty,‚Äù says Rashika, who completed her MBBS just recently. For house surgeons like her, this has been a scary experience as none of them knew anything about the disease. ‚ÄúWith all the guidance from our seniors, all of us interns are now doing a good job and no one would believe we are fresh interns,‚Äù she adds.

Rashika‚Äôs younger brother Rehaan (18) is also a doctor in waiting, says the family, adding how they are currently preparing for the upcoming NEET exam. Having three corona warriors at home has inspired him further. ‚ÄúI just remind myself that I have three family members fighting a huge pandemic. This pushes me to achieve my goal,‚Äù says Rehaan.

To all those who fear contracting Covid-19, Dr Khan says there is nothing to worry about. The government and the health department are closely monitoring the developments and the citizens need to merely follow the instructions and stay at home, he emphasises. ‚ÄúThis may continue for another month and it might take six to seven months for the disease to vanish. But the same situation may not prevail. It is the responsibility of the public to help fight the virus by staying at home,‚Äù he adds.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs comments.

Ramping up its attack against Beijing, the United States has said that there is a ‚Äúsignificant amount of evidence‚Äù that the novel coronavirus, which has infected millions worldwide, emerged from a Chinese laboratory. China, however, accused the Donald Trump-led administration of ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù and sought proof to justify its statement.

Speaking to ABC news on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, ‚ÄúThere is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.‚Äù

Pompeo, however, briefly contradicted the US intelligence agencies‚Äôs conclusion that the virus was neither man-made nor genetically modified.

‚ÄúThe best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,‚Äù he said.

When the interviewer pointed out that was not the conclusion of the intelligence agencies, he backtracked, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they‚Äôve got it wrong.‚Äù

The State Department is yet to issue any clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs remarks.

Responding to Pompeo‚Äôs remarks, China‚Äôs Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party‚Äôs official People‚Äôs Daily, said in an editorial that he did not have any evidence the virus came from the lab in Wuhan and that he was ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù. It also asked the US to provide proof in this regard.

‚ÄúThe Trump administration continues to engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic,‚Äù the editorial said.

The entire Intelligence Community (IC) has been consistently providing critical support to US policymakers and those responding to the virus, which first broke out in China, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2020

‚ÄúThe Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,‚Äù ODNI said giving its assessment about the infection.

Read in Malayalam here

‚ÄúThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,‚Äù it added.

Last week, Pompeo had said it was not known whether the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a meat market, or somewhere else. On the same day, Trump had said that he was confident it may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence.

A 52-year-old woman working at Amma Unavagam (Amma canteen) tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. She was working at the Gajapathy Lala Street branch near Triplicane in Chennai. Amma Unavagam is a scheme run by the government of Tamil Nadu, providing subsidised food.

The woman has been shifted to Omandhurar Government College and Hospital. Following the report, the Amma Unavagam in Icehouse has been shut and all the employees of the branch are being tested.

In April, the Greater Chennai Corporation, which runs over 400 Amma canteens, said it would serve free food during the lockdown. However, after the government announced that hotels and other food services could operate (only parcel services) after May 4 in non-containment areas, the authorities in-charge of Amma Unavagam instructed respective zonal officers to cancel the free food initiative.

On Monday, Amma Unavagams saw a lukewarm response, with people having to shell out from their own pockets for a meal. Migrant laborers and the needy were thriving on the free food of Amma Unavagams.

Meanwhile, Koyembedu wholesale market in Chennai has turned into a Covid-19 hotspot after 107 people, mostly vendors, loaders, and other workers, tested positive in Cuddalore. All of them are linked to the Koyembedu cluster.

So far, 129 positive cases from Cuddalore, 76 from Villupuram, 63 from Chennai, 42 from Ariyalur, seven from Kancheepuram, and one from Perambalur, Thanjavur, and Tiruvarur are linked to the Koyembedu cluster. Massive contact tracing is underway in the state to find out who had visited the place in the last few weeks.

In Tamil Nadu, 3,023 people (2,015 male, 1,007 female, and a transgender) have tested positive for Covid-19. Of the total cases, Chennai accounts for 1,458 cases, about 48 per cent. On May 3 alone 203 people tested positive in the capital city of Tamil Nadu.

There are 1,611 active cases in Tamil Nadu and 1,379 people have been discharged following treatment. A 44-year-old male from Coimbatore who was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Chennai died on Sunday, taking the death toll to 30 in the state.

The Khans are the high-flying superstars of Indian Airlines Colony in Begumpet, Hyderabad. Even as the entire nation grapples with the novel coronavirus pandemic amid a nationwide lockdown, the Khans are at the forefront of fighting COVID-19, as a family.

On March 3, after several weeks, the three doctors in the Khan family were at home together after a felicitation ceremony where they were showered with rose petals by residents of their colony. ‚ÄúThey are the real heroes. They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work,‚Äù says Gopal Giridhar, a colony resident.

With 22 years of service, Dr Mahboob Khan (56) now works as Superintendent of the Government Chest Hospital which is treating many Covid-19 patients. Despite this, the pulmonologist was overwhelmed by the unprecedented show of support from his neighbours, that too at a time when many doctors across India are facing hostile neighbours. The family has been living in the neighbourhood for the last six years.

‚ÄúYes, we were scared initially as we were dealing with an unknown enemy. Anyone could get infected.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2020

‚ÄúThe Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,‚Äù ODNI said giving its assessment about the infection.

‚ÄúThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,‚Äù it added.

Last week, Pompeo had said it was not known whether the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a meat market, or somewhere else. On the same day, Trump had said that he was confident it may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence.

A 52-year-old woman working at Amma Unavagam (Amma canteen) tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. She was working at the Gajapathy Lala Street branch near Triplicane in Chennai. Amma Unavagam is a scheme run by the government of Tamil Nadu, providing subsidised food.

The woman has been shifted to Omandhurar Government College and Hospital. Following the report, the Amma Unavagam in Icehouse has been shut and all the employees of the branch are being tested.

In April, the Greater Chennai Corporation, which runs over 400 Amma canteens, said it would serve free food during the lockdown. However, after the government announced that hotels and other food services could operate (only parcel services) after May 4 in non-containment areas, the authorities in-charge of Amma Unavagam instructed respective zonal officers to cancel the free food initiative.

On Monday, Amma Unavagams saw a lukewarm response, with people having to shell out from their own pockets for a meal. Migrant laborers and the needy were thriving on the free food of Amma Unavagams.

Meanwhile, Koyembedu wholesale market in Chennai has turned into a Covid-19 hotspot after 107 people, mostly vendors, loaders, and other workers, tested positive in Cuddalore. All of them are linked to the Koyembedu cluster.

So far, 129 positive cases from Cuddalore, 76 from Villupuram, 63 from Chennai, 42 from Ariyalur, seven from Kancheepuram, and one from Perambalur, Thanjavur, and Tiruvarur are linked to the Koyembedu cluster. Massive contact tracing is underway in the state to find out who had visited the place in the last few weeks.

In Tamil Nadu, 3,023 people (2,015 male, 1,007 female, and a transgender) have tested positive for Covid-19. Of the total cases, Chennai accounts for 1,458 cases, about 48 per cent. On May 3 alone 203 people tested positive in the capital city of Tamil Nadu.

There are 1,611 active cases in Tamil Nadu and 1,379 people have been discharged following treatment. A 44-year-old male from Coimbatore who was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Chennai died on Sunday, taking the death toll to 30 in the state.

They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work.‚Äù



Share





The Khans are the high-flying superstars of Indian Airlines Colony in Begumpet, Hyderabad. Even as the entire nation grapples with the novel coronavirus pandemic amid a nationwide lockdown, the Khans are at the forefront of fighting COVID-19, as a family.

On March 3, after several weeks, the three doctors in the Khan family were at home together after a felicitation ceremony where they were showered with rose petals by residents of their colony. ‚ÄúThey are the real heroes. They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work,‚Äù says Gopal Giridhar, a colony resident.

With 22 years of service, Dr Mahboob Khan (56) now works as Superintendent of the Government Chest Hospital which is treating many Covid-19 patients. Despite this, the pulmonologist was overwhelmed by the unprecedented show of support from his neighbours, that too at a time when many doctors across India are facing hostile neighbours. The family has been living in the neighbourhood for the last six years.

‚ÄúYes, we were scared initially as we were dealing with an unknown enemy. Anyone could get infected. There were incidents of medical and health workers contracting the disease and some even lost their lives,‚Äù admits Dr Khan who was part of the team of doctors and experts sent from Telangana to Kerala this February to study the latter‚Äôs experience of dealing with the disease.

Rajender, president of the residents welfare association, is happy that the felicitation was a success. ‚ÄúWe did not have enough time and in the short notice, we could mobilise so many people. This means that our people would come out for a good cause even in times of a pandemic,‚Äù he says, adding that they took special care in ensuring people maintain social distance during the small event.

Telangana recorded its first active case on March 1 and by the third week there was a sudden surge in the number of positive cases after 10 Indonesian nationals who reached Karimnagar after participating in the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi were tested positive for the disease.

As of May 3, Telangana has had 1,082 positive cases. As many as 545 of them have been discharged and sent to home quarantine. There are 508 active cases in hospitals, whereas 29 have succumbed.

Dr Khan‚Äôs 48-year-old wife Dr Shahana Khan works at the Gandhi Hospital where their daughter Dr Rashika Khan (22) is a house surgeon. Gandhi hospital, the nodal centre for treating COVID-19 in the state, treated almost 90 per cent of the total 545 patients cured of the disease so far.

The trio has seen hundreds of patients now. But is the daily stress of taking on this unknown enemy, tiring Dr Khan out? ‚ÄúNo way. Dealing with the disease requires us to constantly update ourselves. The appreciation and encouragement keeps us going,‚Äù he says.

However, as an administrator, he agrees, the last month has been stressful. Many a time, when the doctors or health workers found themselves in doubt, it was up to the administrative head to keep the flock together. Taking the medical and health community together with conviction, motivating them, and boosting their morale was a challenge initially.

‚ÄúI say time is the best medicine,‚Äù he says, pointing out that there was panic among doctors, health workers, patients, and the society. Health workers were asked to stay away from their homes and localities. Now the same society appreciates their work, he says. This, according to him, is because of the high recovery rates of patients.

Covid-19 has become part of their lives and is the most common topic of discussion at their dinner table, adds Dr Shahana. ‚ÄúI have to take care of our home too. I cannot neglect the family and patients are equally in need of us. So we do not hesitate to discuss Covid-19 at home and that helps,‚Äù she says.

With no domestic help available, Dr Shahana says her work at home has only doubled. She points at her mother, 72-year-old Azimunnisa Begum, who stays with them. ‚ÄúEspecially now, she needs more care. She is diabetic and has hypertension,‚Äù she adds.

Meanwhile, relatives and friends are worried for the family‚Äôs well-being. The family is flooded with phone calls from relatives across the country. Friends, too, keep checking on them. ‚ÄúThey appreciate our work and say they are proud of us. That is great to hear,‚Äù adds Dr Khan.

For the youngest doctor in the family, it was almost a baptism by fire. Dr Rashika had always wanted to become a doctor like her parents. ‚ÄúBut I never expected my internship to start this way. From Day One, everyone is posted in COVID duty,‚Äù says Rashika, who completed her MBBS just recently. For house surgeons like her, this has been a scary experience as none of them knew anything about the disease. ‚ÄúWith all the guidance from our seniors, all of us interns are now doing a good job and no one would believe we are fresh interns,‚Äù she adds.

Rashika‚Äôs younger brother Rehaan (18) is also a doctor in waiting, says the family, adding how they are currently preparing for the upcoming NEET exam. Having three corona warriors at home has inspired him further. ‚ÄúI just remind myself that I have three family members fighting a huge pandemic. This pushes me to achieve my goal,‚Äù says Rehaan.

To all those who fear contracting Covid-19, Dr Khan says there is nothing to worry about. The government and the health department are closely monitoring the developments and the citizens need to merely follow the instructions and stay at home, he emphasises. ‚ÄúThis may continue for another month and it might take six to seven months for the disease to vanish. But the same situation may not prevail. It is the responsibility of the public to help fight the virus by staying at home,‚Äù he adds.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs comments.

Ramping up its attack against Beijing, the United States has said that there is a ‚Äúsignificant amount of evidence‚Äù that the novel coronavirus, which has infected millions worldwide, emerged from a Chinese laboratory. China, however, accused the Donald Trump-led administration of ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù and sought proof to justify its statement.

Speaking to ABC news on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, ‚ÄúThere is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.‚Äù

Pompeo, however, briefly contradicted the US intelligence agencies‚Äôs conclusion that the virus was neither man-made nor genetically modified.

‚ÄúThe best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,‚Äù he said.

When the interviewer pointed out that was not the conclusion of the intelligence agencies, he backtracked, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they‚Äôve got it wrong.‚Äù

The State Department is yet to issue any clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs remarks.

Responding to Pompeo‚Äôs remarks, China‚Äôs Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party‚Äôs official People‚Äôs Daily, said in an editorial that he did not have any evidence the virus came from the lab in Wuhan and that he was ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù. It also asked the US to provide proof in this regard.

‚ÄúThe Trump administration continues to engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic,‚Äù the editorial said.

The entire Intelligence Community (IC) has been consistently providing critical support to US policymakers and those responding to the virus, which first broke out in China, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.

One great way to boost immunity could be to incorporate more healthy food in one‚Äôs diet. What if we tell you that your kitchen condiments can come to your rescue? Here's our quick fix to boost your immunity."

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs comments.

Ramping up its attack against Beijing, the United States has said that there is a ‚Äúsignificant amount of evidence‚Äù that the novel coronavirus, which has infected millions worldwide, emerged from a Chinese laboratory. China, however, accused the Donald Trump-led administration of ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù and sought proof to justify its statement.

Speaking to ABC news on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, ‚ÄúThere is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.‚Äù

Pompeo, however, briefly contradicted the US intelligence agencies‚Äôs conclusion that the virus was neither man-made nor genetically modified.

‚ÄúThe best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,‚Äù he said.

When the interviewer pointed out that was not the conclusion of the intelligence agencies, he backtracked, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they‚Äôve got it wrong.‚Äù

The State Department is yet to issue any clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs remarks.

Responding to Pompeo‚Äôs remarks, China‚Äôs Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party‚Äôs official People‚Äôs Daily, said in an editorial that he did not have any evidence the virus came from the lab in Wuhan and that he was ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù. It also asked the US to provide proof in this regard.

‚ÄúThe Trump administration continues to engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic,‚Äù the editorial said.

The entire Intelligence Community (IC) has been consistently providing critical support to US policymakers and those responding to the virus, which first broke out in China, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2020

‚ÄúThe Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,‚Äù ODNI said giving its assessment about the infection.

Read in Malayalam here

‚ÄúThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,‚Äù it added.

Last week, Pompeo had said it was not known whether the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a meat market, or somewhere else. On the same day, Trump had said that he was confident it may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence.

A 52-year-old woman working at Amma Unavagam (Amma canteen) tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. She was working at the Gajapathy Lala Street branch near Triplicane in Chennai. Amma Unavagam is a scheme run by the government of Tamil Nadu, providing subsidised food.

The woman has been shifted to Omandhurar Government College and Hospital. Following the report, the Amma Unavagam in Icehouse has been shut and all the employees of the branch are being tested.

In April, the Greater Chennai Corporation, which runs over 400 Amma canteens, said it would serve free food during the lockdown. However, after the government announced that hotels and other food services could operate (only parcel services) after May 4 in non-containment areas, the authorities in-charge of Amma Unavagam instructed respective zonal officers to cancel the free food initiative.

On Monday, Amma Unavagams saw a lukewarm response, with people having to shell out from their own pockets for a meal. Migrant laborers and the needy were thriving on the free food of Amma Unavagams.

Meanwhile, Koyembedu wholesale market in Chennai has turned into a Covid-19 hotspot after 107 people, mostly vendors, loaders, and other workers, tested positive in Cuddalore. All of them are linked to the Koyembedu cluster.

So far, 129 positive cases from Cuddalore, 76 from Villupuram, 63 from Chennai, 42 from Ariyalur, seven from Kancheepuram, and one from Perambalur, Thanjavur, and Tiruvarur are linked to the Koyembedu cluster. Massive contact tracing is underway in the state to find out who had visited the place in the last few weeks.

In Tamil Nadu, 3,023 people (2,015 male, 1,007 female, and a transgender) have tested positive for Covid-19. Of the total cases, Chennai accounts for 1,458 cases, about 48 per cent. On May 3 alone 203 people tested positive in the capital city of Tamil Nadu.

There are 1,611 active cases in Tamil Nadu and 1,379 people have been discharged following treatment. A 44-year-old male from Coimbatore who was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Chennai died on Sunday, taking the death toll to 30 in the state.

They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work.‚Äù



Share





The Khans are the high-flying superstars of Indian Airlines Colony in Begumpet, Hyderabad. Even as the entire nation grapples with the novel coronavirus pandemic amid a nationwide lockdown, the Khans are at the forefront of fighting COVID-19, as a family.

On March 3, after several weeks, the three doctors in the Khan family were at home together after a felicitation ceremony where they were showered with rose petals by residents of their colony. ‚ÄúThey are the real heroes. They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work,‚Äù says Gopal Giridhar, a colony resident.

With 22 years of service, Dr Mahboob Khan (56) now works as Superintendent of the Government Chest Hospital which is treating many Covid-19 patients. Despite this, the pulmonologist was overwhelmed by the unprecedented show of support from his neighbours, that too at a time when many doctors across India are facing hostile neighbours. The family has been living in the neighbourhood for the last six years.

‚ÄúYes, we were scared initially as we were dealing with an unknown enemy. Anyone could get infected. There were incidents of medical and health workers contracting the disease and some even lost their lives,‚Äù admits Dr Khan who was part of the team of doctors and experts sent from Telangana to Kerala this February to study the latter‚Äôs experience of dealing with the disease.

Rajender, president of the residents welfare association, is happy that the felicitation was a success. ‚ÄúWe did not have enough time and in the short notice, we could mobilise so many people. This means that our people would come out for a good cause even in times of a pandemic,‚Äù he says, adding that they took special care in ensuring people maintain social distance during the small event.

Telangana recorded its first active case on March 1 and by the third week there was a sudden surge in the number of positive cases after 10 Indonesian nationals who reached Karimnagar after participating in the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi were tested positive for the disease.

As of May 3, Telangana has had 1,082 positive cases. As many as 545 of them have been discharged and sent to home quarantine. There are 508 active cases in hospitals, whereas 29 have succumbed.

Dr Khan‚Äôs 48-year-old wife Dr Shahana Khan works at the Gandhi Hospital where their daughter Dr Rashika Khan (22) is a house surgeon. Gandhi hospital, the nodal centre for treating COVID-19 in the state, treated almost 90 per cent of the total 545 patients cured of the disease so far.

The trio has seen hundreds of patients now. But is the daily stress of taking on this unknown enemy, tiring Dr Khan out? ‚ÄúNo way. Dealing with the disease requires us to constantly update ourselves. The appreciation and encouragement keeps us going,‚Äù he says.

However, as an administrator, he agrees, the last month has been stressful. Many a time, when the doctors or health workers found themselves in doubt, it was up to the administrative head to keep the flock together. Taking the medical and health community together with conviction, motivating them, and boosting their morale was a challenge initially.

‚ÄúI say time is the best medicine,‚Äù he says, pointing out that there was panic among doctors, health workers, patients, and the society. Health workers were asked to stay away from their homes and localities. Now the same society appreciates their work, he says. This, according to him, is because of the high recovery rates of patients.

Covid-19 has become part of their lives and is the most common topic of discussion at their dinner table, adds Dr Shahana. ‚ÄúI have to take care of our home too. I cannot neglect the family and patients are equally in need of us. So we do not hesitate to discuss Covid-19 at home and that helps,‚Äù she says.

With no domestic help available, Dr Shahana says her work at home has only doubled. She points at her mother, 72-year-old Azimunnisa Begum, who stays with them. ‚ÄúEspecially now, she needs more care. She is diabetic and has hypertension,‚Äù she adds.

Meanwhile, relatives and friends are worried for the family‚Äôs well-being. The family is flooded with phone calls from relatives across the country. Friends, too, keep checking on them. ‚ÄúThey appreciate our work and say they are proud of us. That is great to hear,‚Äù adds Dr Khan.

For the youngest doctor in the family, it was almost a baptism by fire. Dr Rashika had always wanted to become a doctor like her parents. ‚ÄúBut I never expected my internship to start this way. From Day One, everyone is posted in COVID duty,‚Äù says Rashika, who completed her MBBS just recently. For house surgeons like her, this has been a scary experience as none of them knew anything about the disease. ‚ÄúWith all the guidance from our seniors, all of us interns are now doing a good job and no one would believe we are fresh interns,‚Äù she adds.

Rashika‚Äôs younger brother Rehaan (18) is also a doctor in waiting, says the family, adding how they are currently preparing for the upcoming NEET exam. Having three corona warriors at home has inspired him further. ‚ÄúI just remind myself that I have three family members fighting a huge pandemic. This pushes me to achieve my goal,‚Äù says Rehaan.

To all those who fear contracting Covid-19, Dr Khan says there is nothing to worry about. The government and the health department are closely monitoring the developments and the citizens need to merely follow the instructions and stay at home, he emphasises. ‚ÄúThis may continue for another month and it might take six to seven months for the disease to vanish. But the same situation may not prevail. It is the responsibility of the public to help fight the virus by staying at home,‚Äù he adds.

With no domestic help available, Dr Shahana says her work at home has only doubled. She points at her mother, 72-year-old Azimunnisa Begum, who stays with them. ‚ÄúEspecially now, she needs more care. She is diabetic and has hypertension,‚Äù she adds.

Meanwhile, relatives and friends are worried for the family‚Äôs well-being. The family is flooded with phone calls from relatives across the country. Friends, too, keep checking on them. ‚ÄúThey appreciate our work and say they are proud of us. That is great to hear,‚Äù adds Dr Khan.

For the youngest doctor in the family, it was almost a baptism by fire. Dr Rashika had always wanted to become a doctor like her parents. ‚ÄúBut I never expected my internship to start this way. From Day One, everyone is posted in COVID duty,‚Äù says Rashika, who completed her MBBS just recently. For house surgeons like her, this has been a scary experience as none of them knew anything about the disease. ‚ÄúWith all the guidance from our seniors, all of us interns are now doing a good job and no one would believe we are fresh interns,‚Äù she adds.

Rashika‚Äôs younger brother Rehaan (18) is also a doctor in waiting, says the family, adding how they are currently preparing for the upcoming NEET exam. Having three corona warriors at home has inspired him further. ‚ÄúI just remind myself that I have three family members fighting a huge pandemic. This pushes me to achieve my goal,‚Äù says Rehaan.

To all those who fear contracting Covid-19, Dr Khan says there is nothing to worry about. The government and the health department are closely monitoring the developments and the citizens need to merely follow the instructions and stay at home, he emphasises. ‚ÄúThis may continue for another month and it might take six to seven months for the disease to vanish. But the same situation may not prevail. It is the responsibility of the public to help fight the virus by staying at home,‚Äù he adds.

The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs comments.

Ramping up its attack against Beijing, the United States has said that there is a ‚Äúsignificant amount of evidence‚Äù that the novel coronavirus, which has infected millions worldwide, emerged from a Chinese laboratory. China, however, accused the Donald Trump-led administration of ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù and sought proof to justify its statement.

Speaking to ABC news on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said, ‚ÄúThere is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.‚Äù

Pompeo, however, briefly contradicted the US intelligence agencies‚Äôs conclusion that the virus was neither man-made nor genetically modified.

‚ÄúThe best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point,‚Äù he said.

When the interviewer pointed out that was not the conclusion of the intelligence agencies, he backtracked, saying: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen what the intelligence community has said. I have no reason to believe that they‚Äôve got it wrong.‚Äù

The State Department is yet to issue any clarification on Pompeo‚Äôs remarks.

Responding to Pompeo‚Äôs remarks, China‚Äôs Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party‚Äôs official People‚Äôs Daily, said in an editorial that he did not have any evidence the virus came from the lab in Wuhan and that he was ‚Äúbluffing‚Äù. It also asked the US to provide proof in this regard.

‚ÄúThe Trump administration continues to engage in unprecedented propaganda warfare while trying to impede global efforts in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic,‚Äù the editorial said.

The entire Intelligence Community (IC) has been consistently providing critical support to US policymakers and those responding to the virus, which first broke out in China, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) said in a statement.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the U.S. Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner‚Ä¶ ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 3, 2020

‚ÄúThe Intelligence Community also concurs with the wide scientific consensus that the Covid-19 virus was not manmade or genetically modified,‚Äù ODNI said giving its assessment about the infection.

Read in Malayalam here

‚ÄúThe IC will continue to rigorously examine emerging information and intelligence to determine whether the outbreak began through contact with infected animals or if it was the result of an accident at a laboratory in Wuhan,‚Äù it added.

Last week, Pompeo had said it was not known whether the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, a meat market, or somewhere else. On the same day, Trump had said that he was confident it may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence.

A 52-year-old woman working at Amma Unavagam (Amma canteen) tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday. She was working at the Gajapathy Lala Street branch near Triplicane in Chennai. Amma Unavagam is a scheme run by the government of Tamil Nadu, providing subsidised food.

The woman has been shifted to Omandhurar Government College and Hospital. Following the report, the Amma Unavagam in Icehouse has been shut and all the employees of the branch are being tested.

In April, the Greater Chennai Corporation, which runs over 400 Amma canteens, said it would serve free food during the lockdown. However, after the government announced that hotels and other food services could operate (only parcel services) after May 4 in non-containment areas, the authorities in-charge of Amma Unavagam instructed respective zonal officers to cancel the free food initiative.

On Monday, Amma Unavagams saw a lukewarm response, with people having to shell out from their own pockets for a meal. Migrant laborers and the needy were thriving on the free food of Amma Unavagams.

Meanwhile, Koyembedu wholesale market in Chennai has turned into a Covid-19 hotspot after 107 people, mostly vendors, loaders, and other workers, tested positive in Cuddalore. All of them are linked to the Koyembedu cluster.

So far, 129 positive cases from Cuddalore, 76 from Villupuram, 63 from Chennai, 42 from Ariyalur, seven from Kancheepuram, and one from Perambalur, Thanjavur, and Tiruvarur are linked to the Koyembedu cluster. Massive contact tracing is underway in the state to find out who had visited the place in the last few weeks.

In Tamil Nadu, 3,023 people (2,015 male, 1,007 female, and a transgender) have tested positive for Covid-19. Of the total cases, Chennai accounts for 1,458 cases, about 48 per cent. On May 3 alone 203 people tested positive in the capital city of Tamil Nadu.

There are 1,611 active cases in Tamil Nadu and 1,379 people have been discharged following treatment. A 44-year-old male from Coimbatore who was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital in Chennai died on Sunday, taking the death toll to 30 in the state.

They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work.‚Äù



Share





The Khans are the high-flying superstars of Indian Airlines Colony in Begumpet, Hyderabad. Even as the entire nation grapples with the novel coronavirus pandemic amid a nationwide lockdown, the Khans are at the forefront of fighting COVID-19, as a family.

On March 3, after several weeks, the three doctors in the Khan family were at home together after a felicitation ceremony where they were showered with rose petals by residents of their colony. ‚ÄúThey are the real heroes. They are doing a great job, fighting COVID from the forefront. Right from the Prime Minister, everyone appreciates their work,‚Äù says Gopal Giridhar, a colony resident.

With 22 years of service, Dr Mahboob Khan (56) now works as Superintendent of the Government Chest Hospital which is treating many Covid-19 patients. Despite this, the pulmonologist was overwhelmed by the unprecedented show of support from his neighbours, that too at a time when many doctors across India are facing hostile neighbours. The family has been living in the neighbourhood for the last six years.

‚ÄúYes, we were scared initially as we were dealing with an unknown enemy. Anyone could get infected. There were incidents of medical and health workers contracting the disease and some even lost their lives,‚Äù admits Dr Khan who was part of the team of doctors and experts sent from Telangana to Kerala this February to study the latter‚Äôs experience of dealing with the disease.

Rajender, president of the residents welfare association, is happy that the felicitation was a success. ‚ÄúWe did not have enough time and in the short notice, we could mobilise so many people. This means that our people would come out for a good cause even in times of a pandemic,‚Äù he says, adding that they took special care in ensuring people maintain social distance during the small event.

Telangana recorded its first active case on March 1 and by the third week there was a sudden surge in the number of positive cases after 10 Indonesian nationals who reached Karimnagar after participating in the Nizamuddin Markaz in Delhi were tested positive for the disease.

As of May 3, Telangana has had 1,082 positive cases. As many as 545 of them have been discharged and sent to home quarantine. There are 508 active cases in hospitals, whereas 29 have succumbed.

Dr Khan‚Äôs 48-year-old wife Dr Shahana Khan works at the Gandhi Hospital where their daughter Dr Rashika Khan (22) is a house surgeon. Gandhi hospital, the nodal centre for treating COVID-19 in the state, treated almost 90 per cent of the total 545 patients cured of the disease so far.

The trio has seen hundreds of patients now. But is the daily stress of taking on this unknown enemy, tiring Dr Khan out? ‚ÄúNo way. Dealing with the disease requires us to constantly update ourselves. The appreciation and encouragement keeps us going,‚Äù he says.

However, as an administrator, he agrees, the last month has been stressful. Many a time, when the doctors or health workers found themselves in doubt, it was up to the administrative head to keep the flock together. Taking the medical and health community together with conviction, motivating them, and boosting their morale was a challenge initially.

‚ÄúI say time is the best medicine,‚Äù he says, pointing out that there was panic among doctors, health workers, patients, and the society. Health workers were asked to stay away from their homes and localities. Now the same society appreciates their work, he says. This, according to him, is because of the high recovery rates of patients.

Covid-19 has become part of their lives and is the most common topic of discussion at their dinner table, adds Dr Shahana. ‚ÄúI have to take care of our home too. I cannot neglect the family and patients are equally in need of us. So we do not hesitate to discuss Covid-19 at home and that helps,‚Äù she says.

With no domestic help available, Dr Shahana says her work at home has only doubled. She points at her mother, 72-year-old Azimunnisa Begum, who stays with them. ‚ÄúEspecially now, she needs more care. She is diabetic and has hypertension,‚Äù she adds.

Meanwhile, relatives and friends are worried for the family‚Äôs well-being. The family is flooded with phone calls from relatives across the country. Friends, too, keep checking on them. ‚ÄúThey appreciate our work and say they are proud of us. That is great to hear,‚Äù adds Dr Khan.

Chinese leaders 'intentionally concealed the severity' of the disease, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security report dated May 1 which is in the hands of The Associated Press, as per a PTI report.

This revelation comes in the wake of Trump's bashing of China on the public forum. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said China was responsible spreading COVID-19 and must own up to it.

USA feels that China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies.

The report also accuses China of not telling WHO that coronavirus 'was a contagion' for the most part of January so that it could take in medical supplies from abroad.

Trump has speculated that China could have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible 'mistake'.

COVID-19 Wasn't Enough, Poisonous Giant Hornets Are Rising In The US And Canada

2020 is getting from bad to worse to downright dreadful, from the looks of it. We‚Äôve seen how with every passing month this year has been filled with non-stop bad news.

And while COVID-19 pandemic is surely the worst of the lot, a new problem might be on the brink of surfacing, posing new challenges to human life.

Washington State University

US‚Äôs Washington State and Canada has spotted ‚Äòmurder hornets‚Äô surfacing in large numbers. In case you were wondering hornets aren‚Äôt technically harmful except for their painful sting, only the ones resurging in North America aren‚Äôt the normal kind.

They‚Äôre Asian Giant Hornets (yeah I know the name makes everything a whole lot worse) and as their name suggests they‚Äôre quite large than normal hornets. But that‚Äôs not all.

The murder hornets

The murder hornets are also known for their stings -- they‚Äôre venomous. The stings are in fact known to kill around 50 people every year in Japan.

And they can be truly regarded as the monsters of the bug world as these feed themselves by actually tearing apart heads off bees and actually flying their headless body to the young hornets to feed.

Washington State University

Their stings deliver potent venom that is as deadly as a venomous snake bite, but only if you‚Äôre attacked by a swarm. Unlike bees, they can puncture you multiple times using stingers nearly as long as a hypodermic needle.



How did it come to the US?

What‚Äôs more astonishing is that they aren‚Äôt supposed to be in the US as they‚Äôre mostly found in Asia. And researchers aren‚Äôt able to find out why this is the case. They feel that they were transported in International cargo, either accidentally or deliberately.

Susan Cobey, a bee breeder with Washington State University‚Äôs Department of Entomology, in a recent statement. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face.‚Äù

But in case you were wondering we should be now ready with powerful bug spray to keep these hornets away, the biggest problem is for the bees. You see, Asian Giant Hornets feast on honey bees.

They feast on bees

These hornets are capable of destroying an entire beehive full of hundreds of honey bees in a matter of hours. While their population is already endangered due to several issues, the Asian Giant Hornets will only make matters worse.

Officials have teamed up to stop the hornet population from rising. Usually, around April the queen comes out of hibernation while other male hornets scout and build underground dens to nest. They‚Äôre the most destructive during late summer as they desperately hunt for food to sustain food for next year‚Äôs queen.

Stopping their population from rising

According to Chris Looney, an entomologist with Washington State Department of Agriculture, in a conversation with New York Times, ‚ÄúThis is our window to keep it from establishing. If we can‚Äôt do it in the next couple of years, it probably can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù

They‚Äôve created makeshift traps to catch these large bugs. Moreover, they‚Äôre also teaming up with local beekeepers as well as scientists with WSU to keep a track on the population.

According to Murray, ‚ÄúWe need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.‚Äù

Is climate change to blame for this?

While there is no clear answer to their rising population in a region they‚Äôre not found, is climate change responsible for this? It won‚Äôt be surprising considering it has already caused several animals to change the way they function -- bears aren‚Äôt hibernating, snow leopards are being spotted in human-populated areas. It won‚Äôt be surprising if this really is the case. What do you feel? Tell us in the comments section below."

COVID-19 Wasn't Enough, Poisonous Giant Hornets Are Rising In The US And Canada

2020 is getting from bad to worse to downright dreadful, from the looks of it. We‚Äôve seen how with every passing month this year has been filled with non-stop bad news.

And while COVID-19 pandemic is surely the worst of the lot, a new problem might be on the brink of surfacing, posing new challenges to human life.

Washington State University

US‚Äôs Washington State and Canada has spotted ‚Äòmurder hornets‚Äô surfacing in large numbers. In case you were wondering hornets aren‚Äôt technically harmful except for their painful sting, only the ones resurging in North America aren‚Äôt the normal kind.

They‚Äôre Asian Giant Hornets (yeah I know the name makes everything a whole lot worse) and as their name suggests they‚Äôre quite large than normal hornets. But that‚Äôs not all.

The murder hornets

The murder hornets are also known for their stings -- they‚Äôre venomous. The stings are in fact known to kill around 50 people every year in Japan.

And they can be truly regarded as the monsters of the bug world as these feed themselves by actually tearing apart heads off bees and actually flying their headless body to the young hornets to feed.

Washington State University

Their stings deliver potent venom that is as deadly as a venomous snake bite, but only if you‚Äôre attacked by a swarm. Unlike bees, they can puncture you multiple times using stingers nearly as long as a hypodermic needle.



How did it come to the US?

What‚Äôs more astonishing is that they aren‚Äôt supposed to be in the US as they‚Äôre mostly found in Asia. And researchers aren‚Äôt able to find out why this is the case. They feel that they were transported in International cargo, either accidentally or deliberately.

Susan Cobey, a bee breeder with Washington State University‚Äôs Department of Entomology, in a recent statement. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face.‚Äù

But in case you were wondering we should be now ready with powerful bug spray to keep these hornets away, the biggest problem is for the bees. You see, Asian Giant Hornets feast on honey bees.

They feast on bees

These hornets are capable of destroying an entire beehive full of hundreds of honey bees in a matter of hours. While their population is already endangered due to several issues, the Asian Giant Hornets will only make matters worse.

Officials have teamed up to stop the hornet population from rising. Usually, around April the queen comes out of hibernation while other male hornets scout and build underground dens to nest. They‚Äôre the most destructive during late summer as they desperately hunt for food to sustain food for next year‚Äôs queen.

COVID-19 Wasn't Enough, Poisonous Giant Hornets Are Rising In The US And Canada

2020 is getting from bad to worse to downright dreadful, from the looks of it. We‚Äôve seen how with every passing month this year has been filled with non-stop bad news.

And while COVID-19 pandemic is surely the worst of the lot, a new problem might be on the brink of surfacing, posing new challenges to human life.

Washington State University

US‚Äôs Washington State and Canada has spotted ‚Äòmurder hornets‚Äô surfacing in large numbers. In case you were wondering hornets aren‚Äôt technically harmful except for their painful sting, only the ones resurging in North America aren‚Äôt the normal kind.

They‚Äôre Asian Giant Hornets (yeah I know the name makes everything a whole lot worse) and as their name suggests they‚Äôre quite large than normal hornets. But that‚Äôs not all.

The murder hornets

The murder hornets are also known for their stings -- they‚Äôre venomous. The stings are in fact known to kill around 50 people every year in Japan.

And they can be truly regarded as the monsters of the bug world as these feed themselves by actually tearing apart heads off bees and actually flying their headless body to the young hornets to feed.

Washington State University

Their stings deliver potent venom that is as deadly as a venomous snake bite, but only if you‚Äôre attacked by a swarm. Unlike bees, they can puncture you multiple times using stingers nearly as long as a hypodermic needle.



How did it come to the US?

What‚Äôs more astonishing is that they aren‚Äôt supposed to be in the US as they‚Äôre mostly found in Asia. And researchers aren‚Äôt able to find out why this is the case. They feel that they were transported in International cargo, either accidentally or deliberately.

They feast on bees

These hornets are capable of destroying an entire beehive full of hundreds of honey bees in a matter of hours. While their population is already endangered due to several issues, the Asian Giant Hornets will only make matters worse.

Officials have teamed up to stop the hornet population from rising. Usually, around April the queen comes out of hibernation while other male hornets scout and build underground dens to nest. They‚Äôre the most destructive during late summer as they desperately hunt for food to sustain food for next year‚Äôs queen.

Stopping their population from rising

According to Chris Looney, an entomologist with Washington State Department of Agriculture, in a conversation with New York Times, ‚ÄúThis is our window to keep it from establishing. If we can‚Äôt do it in the next couple of years, it probably can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù

They‚Äôve created makeshift traps to catch these large bugs. Moreover, they‚Äôre also teaming up with local beekeepers as well as scientists with WSU to keep a track on the population.

According to Murray, ‚ÄúWe need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.‚Äù

Is climate change to blame for this?

While there is no clear answer to their rising population in a region they‚Äôre not found, is climate change responsible for this? It won‚Äôt be surprising considering it has already caused several animals to change the way they function -- bears aren‚Äôt hibernating, snow leopards are being spotted in human-populated areas.

These hornets are capable of destroying an entire beehive full of hundreds of honey bees in a matter of hours. While their population is already endangered due to several issues, the Asian Giant Hornets will only make matters worse.

Officials have teamed up to stop the hornet population from rising. Usually, around April the queen comes out of hibernation while other male hornets scout and build underground dens to nest. They‚Äôre the most destructive during late summer as they desperately hunt for food to sustain food for next year‚Äôs queen.

Stopping their population from rising

According to Chris Looney, an entomologist with Washington State Department of Agriculture, in a conversation with New York Times, ‚ÄúThis is our window to keep it from establishing. If we can‚Äôt do it in the next couple of years, it probably can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù

They‚Äôve created makeshift traps to catch these large bugs. Moreover, they‚Äôre also teaming up with local beekeepers as well as scientists with WSU to keep a track on the population.

According to Murray, ‚ÄúWe need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.‚Äù

Is climate change to blame for this?

While there is no clear answer to their rising population in a region they‚Äôre not found, is climate change responsible for this? It won‚Äôt be surprising considering it has already caused several animals to change the way they function -- bears aren‚Äôt hibernating, snow leopards are being spotted in human-populated areas.

COVID-19 Wasn't Enough, Poisonous Giant Hornets Are Rising In The US And Canada

2020 is getting from bad to worse to downright dreadful, from the looks of it. We‚Äôve seen how with every passing month this year has been filled with non-stop bad news.

And while COVID-19 pandemic is surely the worst of the lot, a new problem might be on the brink of surfacing, posing new challenges to human life.

Washington State University

US‚Äôs Washington State and Canada has spotted ‚Äòmurder hornets‚Äô surfacing in large numbers. In case you were wondering hornets aren‚Äôt technically harmful except for their painful sting, only the ones resurging in North America aren‚Äôt the normal kind.

They‚Äôre Asian Giant Hornets (yeah I know the name makes everything a whole lot worse) and as their name suggests they‚Äôre quite large than normal hornets. But that‚Äôs not all.

The murder hornets

The murder hornets are also known for their stings -- they‚Äôre venomous. The stings are in fact known to kill around 50 people every year in Japan.

And they can be truly regarded as the monsters of the bug world as these feed themselves by actually tearing apart heads off bees and actually flying their headless body to the young hornets to feed.

Washington State University

Their stings deliver potent venom that is as deadly as a venomous snake bite, but only if you‚Äôre attacked by a swarm. Unlike bees, they can puncture you multiple times using stingers nearly as long as a hypodermic needle.



How did it come to the US?

What‚Äôs more astonishing is that they aren‚Äôt supposed to be in the US as they‚Äôre mostly found in Asia. And researchers aren‚Äôt able to find out why this is the case. They feel that they were transported in International cargo, either accidentally or deliberately.

Susan Cobey, a bee breeder with Washington State University‚Äôs Department of Entomology, in a recent statement. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face.‚Äù

COVID-19 Wasn't Enough, Poisonous Giant Hornets Are Rising In The US And Canada

2020 is getting from bad to worse to downright dreadful, from the looks of it. We‚Äôve seen how with every passing month this year has been filled with non-stop bad news.

And while COVID-19 pandemic is surely the worst of the lot, a new problem might be on the brink of surfacing, posing new challenges to human life.

Washington State University

US‚Äôs Washington State and Canada has spotted ‚Äòmurder hornets‚Äô surfacing in large numbers. In case you were wondering hornets aren‚Äôt technically harmful except for their painful sting, only the ones resurging in North America aren‚Äôt the normal kind.

They‚Äôre Asian Giant Hornets (yeah I know the name makes everything a whole lot worse) and as their name suggests they‚Äôre quite large than normal hornets. But that‚Äôs not all.

The murder hornets

The murder hornets are also known for their stings -- they‚Äôre venomous. The stings are in fact known to kill around 50 people every year in Japan.

And they can be truly regarded as the monsters of the bug world as these feed themselves by actually tearing apart heads off bees and actually flying their headless body to the young hornets to feed.

Washington State University

Their stings deliver potent venom that is as deadly as a venomous snake bite, but only if you‚Äôre attacked by a swarm. Unlike bees, they can puncture you multiple times using stingers nearly as long as a hypodermic needle.



How did it come to the US?

What‚Äôs more astonishing is that they aren‚Äôt supposed to be in the US as they‚Äôre mostly found in Asia. And researchers aren‚Äôt able to find out why this is the case. They feel that they were transported in International cargo, either accidentally or deliberately.

They feast on bees

These hornets are capable of destroying an entire beehive full of hundreds of honey bees in a matter of hours. While their population is already endangered due to several issues, the Asian Giant Hornets will only make matters worse.

Officials have teamed up to stop the hornet population from rising. Usually, around April the queen comes out of hibernation while other male hornets scout and build underground dens to nest. They‚Äôre the most destructive during late summer as they desperately hunt for food to sustain food for next year‚Äôs queen.

Stopping their population from rising

According to Chris Looney, an entomologist with Washington State Department of Agriculture, in a conversation with New York Times, ‚ÄúThis is our window to keep it from establishing. If we can‚Äôt do it in the next couple of years, it probably can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù

They‚Äôve created makeshift traps to catch these large bugs. Moreover, they‚Äôre also teaming up with local beekeepers as well as scientists with WSU to keep a track on the population.

According to Murray, ‚ÄúWe need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.‚Äù

Is climate change to blame for this?

While there is no clear answer to their rising population in a region they‚Äôre not found, is climate change responsible for this? It won‚Äôt be surprising considering it has already caused several animals to change the way they function -- bears aren‚Äôt hibernating, snow leopards are being spotted in human-populated areas.

They feast on bees

These hornets are capable of destroying an entire beehive full of hundreds of honey bees in a matter of hours. While their population is already endangered due to several issues, the Asian Giant Hornets will only make matters worse.

Officials have teamed up to stop the hornet population from rising. Usually, around April the queen comes out of hibernation while other male hornets scout and build underground dens to nest. They‚Äôre the most destructive during late summer as they desperately hunt for food to sustain food for next year‚Äôs queen.

Stopping their population from rising

According to Chris Looney, an entomologist with Washington State Department of Agriculture, in a conversation with New York Times, ‚ÄúThis is our window to keep it from establishing. If we can‚Äôt do it in the next couple of years, it probably can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù

They‚Äôve created makeshift traps to catch these large bugs. Moreover, they‚Äôre also teaming up with local beekeepers as well as scientists with WSU to keep a track on the population.

According to Murray, ‚ÄúWe need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.‚Äù

Is climate change to blame for this?

While there is no clear answer to their rising population in a region they‚Äôre not found, is climate change responsible for this? It won‚Äôt be surprising considering it has already caused several animals to change the way they function -- bears aren‚Äôt hibernating, snow leopards are being spotted in human-populated areas.

COVID-19 Wasn't Enough, Poisonous Giant Hornets Are Rising In The US And Canada

2020 is getting from bad to worse to downright dreadful, from the looks of it. We‚Äôve seen how with every passing month this year has been filled with non-stop bad news.

And while COVID-19 pandemic is surely the worst of the lot, a new problem might be on the brink of surfacing, posing new challenges to human life.

Washington State University

US‚Äôs Washington State and Canada has spotted ‚Äòmurder hornets‚Äô surfacing in large numbers. In case you were wondering hornets aren‚Äôt technically harmful except for their painful sting, only the ones resurging in North America aren‚Äôt the normal kind.

They‚Äôre Asian Giant Hornets (yeah I know the name makes everything a whole lot worse) and as their name suggests they‚Äôre quite large than normal hornets. But that‚Äôs not all.

The murder hornets

The murder hornets are also known for their stings -- they‚Äôre venomous. The stings are in fact known to kill around 50 people every year in Japan.

And they can be truly regarded as the monsters of the bug world as these feed themselves by actually tearing apart heads off bees and actually flying their headless body to the young hornets to feed.

Washington State University

Their stings deliver potent venom that is as deadly as a venomous snake bite, but only if you‚Äôre attacked by a swarm. Unlike bees, they can puncture you multiple times using stingers nearly as long as a hypodermic needle.



How did it come to the US?

What‚Äôs more astonishing is that they aren‚Äôt supposed to be in the US as they‚Äôre mostly found in Asia. And researchers aren‚Äôt able to find out why this is the case. They feel that they were transported in International cargo, either accidentally or deliberately.

COVID-19 Wasn't Enough, Poisonous Giant Hornets Are Rising In The US And Canada

2020 is getting from bad to worse to downright dreadful, from the looks of it. We‚Äôve seen how with every passing month this year has been filled with non-stop bad news.

And while COVID-19 pandemic is surely the worst of the lot, a new problem might be on the brink of surfacing, posing new challenges to human life.

Washington State University

US‚Äôs Washington State and Canada has spotted ‚Äòmurder hornets‚Äô surfacing in large numbers. In case you were wondering hornets aren‚Äôt technically harmful except for their painful sting, only the ones resurging in North America aren‚Äôt the normal kind.

They‚Äôre Asian Giant Hornets (yeah I know the name makes everything a whole lot worse) and as their name suggests they‚Äôre quite large than normal hornets. But that‚Äôs not all.

The murder hornets

The murder hornets are also known for their stings -- they‚Äôre venomous. The stings are in fact known to kill around 50 people every year in Japan.

And they can be truly regarded as the monsters of the bug world as these feed themselves by actually tearing apart heads off bees and actually flying their headless body to the young hornets to feed.

Washington State University

Their stings deliver potent venom that is as deadly as a venomous snake bite, but only if you‚Äôre attacked by a swarm. Unlike bees, they can puncture you multiple times using stingers nearly as long as a hypodermic needle.



How did it come to the US?

What‚Äôs more astonishing is that they aren‚Äôt supposed to be in the US as they‚Äôre mostly found in Asia. And researchers aren‚Äôt able to find out why this is the case. They feel that they were transported in International cargo, either accidentally or deliberately.

Susan Cobey, a bee breeder with Washington State University‚Äôs Department of Entomology, in a recent statement. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face.‚Äù

But in case you were wondering we should be now ready with powerful bug spray to keep these hornets away, the biggest problem is for the bees. You see, Asian Giant Hornets feast on honey bees.

They feast on bees

These hornets are capable of destroying an entire beehive full of hundreds of honey bees in a matter of hours. While their population is already endangered due to several issues, the Asian Giant Hornets will only make matters worse.

Officials have teamed up to stop the hornet population from rising. Usually, around April the queen comes out of hibernation while other male hornets scout and build underground dens to nest. They‚Äôre the most destructive during late summer as they desperately hunt for food to sustain food for next year‚Äôs queen.

Stopping their population from rising

According to Chris Looney, an entomologist with Washington State Department of Agriculture, in a conversation with New York Times, ‚ÄúThis is our window to keep it from establishing. If we can‚Äôt do it in the next couple of years, it probably can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù

They‚Äôve created makeshift traps to catch these large bugs. Moreover, they‚Äôre also teaming up with local beekeepers as well as scientists with WSU to keep a track on the population.

According to Murray, ‚ÄúWe need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.‚Äù

Is climate change to blame for this?

While there is no clear answer to their rising population in a region they‚Äôre not found, is climate change responsible for this? It won‚Äôt be surprising considering it has already caused several animals to change the way they function -- bears aren‚Äôt hibernating, snow leopards are being spotted in human-populated areas.

And they can be truly regarded as the monsters of the bug world as these feed themselves by actually tearing apart heads off bees and actually flying their headless body to the young hornets to feed.

Washington State University

Their stings deliver potent venom that is as deadly as a venomous snake bite, but only if you‚Äôre attacked by a swarm. Unlike bees, they can puncture you multiple times using stingers nearly as long as a hypodermic needle.



How did it come to the US?

What‚Äôs more astonishing is that they aren‚Äôt supposed to be in the US as they‚Äôre mostly found in Asia. And researchers aren‚Äôt able to find out why this is the case. They feel that they were transported in International cargo, either accidentally or deliberately.

They feast on bees

These hornets are capable of destroying an entire beehive full of hundreds of honey bees in a matter of hours. While their population is already endangered due to several issues, the Asian Giant Hornets will only make matters worse.

Officials have teamed up to stop the hornet population from rising. Usually, around April the queen comes out of hibernation while other male hornets scout and build underground dens to nest. They‚Äôre the most destructive during late summer as they desperately hunt for food to sustain food for next year‚Äôs queen.

Stopping their population from rising

According to Chris Looney, an entomologist with Washington State Department of Agriculture, in a conversation with New York Times, ‚ÄúThis is our window to keep it from establishing. If we can‚Äôt do it in the next couple of years, it probably can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù

They‚Äôve created makeshift traps to catch these large bugs. Moreover, they‚Äôre also teaming up with local beekeepers as well as scientists with WSU to keep a track on the population.

According to Murray, ‚ÄúWe need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.‚Äù

Is climate change to blame for this?

While there is no clear answer to their rising population in a region they‚Äôre not found, is climate change responsible for this?

COVID-19 Wasn't Enough, Poisonous Giant Hornets Are Rising In The US And Canada

2020 is getting from bad to worse to downright dreadful, from the looks of it. We‚Äôve seen how with every passing month this year has been filled with non-stop bad news.

And while COVID-19 pandemic is surely the worst of the lot, a new problem might be on the brink of surfacing, posing new challenges to human life.

Washington State University

US‚Äôs Washington State and Canada has spotted ‚Äòmurder hornets‚Äô surfacing in large numbers. In case you were wondering hornets aren‚Äôt technically harmful except for their painful sting, only the ones resurging in North America aren‚Äôt the normal kind.

They‚Äôre Asian Giant Hornets (yeah I know the name makes everything a whole lot worse) and as their name suggests they‚Äôre quite large than normal hornets. But that‚Äôs not all.

The murder hornets

The murder hornets are also known for their stings -- they‚Äôre venomous. The stings are in fact known to kill around 50 people every year in Japan.

And they can be truly regarded as the monsters of the bug world as these feed themselves by actually tearing apart heads off bees and actually flying their headless body to the young hornets to feed.

Washington State University

Their stings deliver potent venom that is as deadly as a venomous snake bite, but only if you‚Äôre attacked by a swarm. Unlike bees, they can puncture you multiple times using stingers nearly as long as a hypodermic needle.



How did it come to the US?

What‚Äôs more astonishing is that they aren‚Äôt supposed to be in the US as they‚Äôre mostly found in Asia. And researchers aren‚Äôt able to find out why this is the case. They feel that they were transported in International cargo, either accidentally or deliberately.

Susan Cobey, a bee breeder with Washington State University‚Äôs Department of Entomology, in a recent statement. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face.‚Äù

But in case you were wondering we should be now ready with powerful bug spray to keep these hornets away, the biggest problem is for the bees. You see, Asian Giant Hornets feast on honey bees.

They feast on bees

These hornets are capable of destroying an entire beehive full of hundreds of honey bees in a matter of hours. While their population is already endangered due to several issues, the Asian Giant Hornets will only make matters worse.

Officials have teamed up to stop the hornet population from rising. Usually, around April the queen comes out of hibernation while other male hornets scout and build underground dens to nest. They‚Äôre the most destructive during late summer as they desperately hunt for food to sustain food for next year‚Äôs queen.

Stopping their population from rising

According to Chris Looney, an entomologist with Washington State Department of Agriculture, in a conversation with New York Times, ‚ÄúThis is our window to keep it from establishing. If we can‚Äôt do it in the next couple of years, it probably can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù

They‚Äôve created makeshift traps to catch these large bugs. Moreover, they‚Äôre also teaming up with local beekeepers as well as scientists with WSU to keep a track on the population.

According to Murray, ‚ÄúWe need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.‚Äù

Is climate change to blame for this?

While there is no clear answer to their rising population in a region they‚Äôre not found, is climate change responsible for this? It won‚Äôt be surprising considering it has already caused several animals to change the way they function -- bears aren‚Äôt hibernating, snow leopards are being spotted in human-populated areas.

US‚Äôs Washington State and Canada has spotted ‚Äòmurder hornets‚Äô surfacing in large numbers. In case you were wondering hornets aren‚Äôt technically harmful except for their painful sting, only the ones resurging in North America aren‚Äôt the normal kind.

They‚Äôre Asian Giant Hornets (yeah I know the name makes everything a whole lot worse) and as their name suggests they‚Äôre quite large than normal hornets. But that‚Äôs not all.

The murder hornets

The murder hornets are also known for their stings -- they‚Äôre venomous. The stings are in fact known to kill around 50 people every year in Japan.

And they can be truly regarded as the monsters of the bug world as these feed themselves by actually tearing apart heads off bees and actually flying their headless body to the young hornets to feed.

Washington State University

Their stings deliver potent venom that is as deadly as a venomous snake bite, but only if you‚Äôre attacked by a swarm. Unlike bees, they can puncture you multiple times using stingers nearly as long as a hypodermic needle.



How did it come to the US?

What‚Äôs more astonishing is that they aren‚Äôt supposed to be in the US as they‚Äôre mostly found in Asia. And researchers aren‚Äôt able to find out why this is the case. They feel that they were transported in International cargo, either accidentally or deliberately.

They feast on bees

These hornets are capable of destroying an entire beehive full of hundreds of honey bees in a matter of hours. While their population is already endangered due to several issues, the Asian Giant Hornets will only make matters worse.

Officials have teamed up to stop the hornet population from rising. Usually, around April the queen comes out of hibernation while other male hornets scout and build underground dens to nest. They‚Äôre the most destructive during late summer as they desperately hunt for food to sustain food for next year‚Äôs queen.

Stopping their population from rising

According to Chris Looney, an entomologist with Washington State Department of Agriculture, in a conversation with New York Times, ‚ÄúThis is our window to keep it from establishing. If we can‚Äôt do it in the next couple of years, it probably can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù

They‚Äôve created makeshift traps to catch these large bugs. Moreover, they‚Äôre also teaming up with local beekeepers as well as scientists with WSU to keep a track on the population.

According to Murray, ‚ÄúWe need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.‚Äù

Is climate change to blame for this?

While there is no clear answer to their rising population in a region they‚Äôre not found, is climate change responsible for this? It won‚Äôt be surprising considering it has already caused several animals to change the way they function -- bears aren‚Äôt hibernating, snow leopards are being spotted in human-populated areas.

COVID-19 Wasn't Enough, Poisonous Giant Hornets Are Rising In The US And Canada

2020 is getting from bad to worse to downright dreadful, from the looks of it. We‚Äôve seen how with every passing month this year has been filled with non-stop bad news.

And while COVID-19 pandemic is surely the worst of the lot, a new problem might be on the brink of surfacing, posing new challenges to human life.

Washington State University

US‚Äôs Washington State and Canada has spotted ‚Äòmurder hornets‚Äô surfacing in large numbers. In case you were wondering hornets aren‚Äôt technically harmful except for their painful sting, only the ones resurging in North America aren‚Äôt the normal kind.

They‚Äôre Asian Giant Hornets (yeah I know the name makes everything a whole lot worse) and as their name suggests they‚Äôre quite large than normal hornets. But that‚Äôs not all.

The murder hornets

The murder hornets are also known for their stings -- they‚Äôre venomous. The stings are in fact known to kill around 50 people every year in Japan.

And they can be truly regarded as the monsters of the bug world as these feed themselves by actually tearing apart heads off bees and actually flying their headless body to the young hornets to feed.

Washington State University

Their stings deliver potent venom that is as deadly as a venomous snake bite, but only if you‚Äôre attacked by a swarm. Unlike bees, they can puncture you multiple times using stingers nearly as long as a hypodermic needle.



How did it come to the US?

What‚Äôs more astonishing is that they aren‚Äôt supposed to be in the US as they‚Äôre mostly found in Asia. And researchers aren‚Äôt able to find out why this is the case. They feel that they were transported in International cargo, either accidentally or deliberately.

Susan Cobey, a bee breeder with Washington State University‚Äôs Department of Entomology, in a recent statement. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face.‚Äù

But in case you were wondering we should be now ready with powerful bug spray to keep these hornets away, the biggest problem is for the bees. You see, Asian Giant Hornets feast on honey bees.

Todd Murray, an entomologist and invasive species specialist with the university states, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a shockingly large hornet. It‚Äôs a health hazard, and more importantly, a significant predator of honey bees.‚Äù

They feast on bees

These hornets are capable of destroying an entire beehive full of hundreds of honey bees in a matter of hours. While their population is already endangered due to several issues, the Asian Giant Hornets will only make matters worse.

Officials have teamed up to stop the hornet population from rising. Usually, around April the queen comes out of hibernation while other male hornets scout and build underground dens to nest. They‚Äôre the most destructive during late summer as they desperately hunt for food to sustain food for next year‚Äôs queen.

Stopping their population from rising

According to Chris Looney, an entomologist with Washington State Department of Agriculture, in a conversation with New York Times, ‚ÄúThis is our window to keep it from establishing. If we can‚Äôt do it in the next couple of years, it probably can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù

They‚Äôve created makeshift traps to catch these large bugs. Moreover, they‚Äôre also teaming up with local beekeepers as well as scientists with WSU to keep a track on the population.

According to Murray, ‚ÄúWe need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.‚Äù

Is climate change to blame for this?

While there is no clear answer to their rising population in a region they‚Äôre not found, is climate change responsible for this? It won‚Äôt be surprising considering it has already caused several animals to change the way they function -- bears aren‚Äôt hibernating, snow leopards are being spotted in human-populated areas.

COVID-19 Wasn't Enough, Poisonous Giant Hornets Are Rising In The US And Canada

2020 is getting from bad to worse to downright dreadful, from the looks of it. We‚Äôve seen how with every passing month this year has been filled with non-stop bad news.

And while COVID-19 pandemic is surely the worst of the lot, a new problem might be on the brink of surfacing, posing new challenges to human life.

Washington State University

US‚Äôs Washington State and Canada has spotted ‚Äòmurder hornets‚Äô surfacing in large numbers. In case you were wondering hornets aren‚Äôt technically harmful except for their painful sting, only the ones resurging in North America aren‚Äôt the normal kind.

They‚Äôre Asian Giant Hornets (yeah I know the name makes everything a whole lot worse) and as their name suggests they‚Äôre quite large than normal hornets. But that‚Äôs not all.

The murder hornets

The murder hornets are also known for their stings -- they‚Äôre venomous. The stings are in fact known to kill around 50 people every year in Japan.

And they can be truly regarded as the monsters of the bug world as these feed themselves by actually tearing apart heads off bees and actually flying their headless body to the young hornets to feed.

Washington State University

Their stings deliver potent venom that is as deadly as a venomous snake bite, but only if you‚Äôre attacked by a swarm. Unlike bees, they can puncture you multiple times using stingers nearly as long as a hypodermic needle.



How did it come to the US?

What‚Äôs more astonishing is that they aren‚Äôt supposed to be in the US as they‚Äôre mostly found in Asia. And researchers aren‚Äôt able to find out why this is the case. They feel that they were transported in International cargo, either accidentally or deliberately.

Susan Cobey, a bee breeder with Washington State University‚Äôs Department of Entomology, in a recent statement. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre like something out of a monster cartoon with this huge yellow-orange face.‚Äù

But in case you were wondering we should be now ready with powerful bug spray to keep these hornets away, the biggest problem is for the bees. You see, Asian Giant Hornets feast on honey bees.

They feast on bees

These hornets are capable of destroying an entire beehive full of hundreds of honey bees in a matter of hours. While their population is already endangered due to several issues, the Asian Giant Hornets will only make matters worse.

Officials have teamed up to stop the hornet population from rising. Usually, around April the queen comes out of hibernation while other male hornets scout and build underground dens to nest. They‚Äôre the most destructive during late summer as they desperately hunt for food to sustain food for next year‚Äôs queen.

Stopping their population from rising

According to Chris Looney, an entomologist with Washington State Department of Agriculture, in a conversation with New York Times, ‚ÄúThis is our window to keep it from establishing. If we can‚Äôt do it in the next couple of years, it probably can‚Äôt be done.‚Äù

They‚Äôve created makeshift traps to catch these large bugs. Moreover, they‚Äôre also teaming up with local beekeepers as well as scientists with WSU to keep a track on the population.

According to Murray, ‚ÄúWe need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.‚Äù

Is climate change to blame for this?

While there is no clear answer to their rising population in a region they‚Äôre not found, is climate change responsible for this? It won‚Äôt be surprising considering it has already caused several animals to change the way they function -- bears aren‚Äôt hibernating, snow leopards are being spotted in human-populated areas. It won‚Äôt be surprising if this really is the case. What do you feel? Tell us in the comments section below."

They‚Äôve created makeshift traps to catch these large bugs. Moreover, they‚Äôre also teaming up with local beekeepers as well as scientists with WSU to keep a track on the population.

According to Murray, ‚ÄúWe need to teach people how to recognize and identify this hornet while populations are small so that we can eradicate it while we still have a chance.‚Äù

Is climate change to blame for this?

While there is no clear answer to their rising population in a region they‚Äôre not found, is climate change responsible for this? It won‚Äôt be surprising considering it has already caused several animals to change the way they function -- bears aren‚Äôt hibernating, snow leopards are being spotted in human-populated areas. It won‚Äôt be surprising if this really is the case. What do you feel? Tell us in the comments section below."

New Zealand Reports No New Cases Of COVID-19, A Much-Awaited First Since The Outbreak

The day each country is waiting for desperately, New Zealand is already there. The country has recorded its first day of no new cases of COVID-19 after a month-long strict lockdown was put in place.

Ashley Bloomfield, New Zealand‚Äôs director-general of health said, ‚ÄúIt is cause for celebration... It is important that we reflect that it is symbolic of the effort that everybody has put in.""



However, he also added that despite of new cases, the country's citizens must proceed forward with caution. He said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to downplay that but once again, we need to be continuing vigilance.‚Äù

NZME

New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern also warned the people that they should not be 'jeapordising' the situation by breaching the lockdown rules. She said, ‚ÄúAny gains you‚Äôve seen at the moment are actually from the lockdown period. We need to not get ahead of ourselves, stick to our bubble, and finish what we started.""

PM Ardern also mentioned that she will be revisiting the number later this week once the more relaxed rules of the lockdown have had time to set in.

New Zealand has had a total number of 1,487 confirmed cases with 86% of them now recovered. While two people have lost their lives, seven still remain in the hospital. As of Monday, no additional cases have been reported.



Bloomfield also added, ‚ÄúWe are still wanting to be sure that there is no undetected community transmission.""



New Zealand's efficient government is being praised around the world including from the World Health Organisation for their strict lockdown which was able to contain the spreading of the deadly virus. There were no deaths at the time the lockdown was imposed since it was done so swiftly.

Last week, the country witnessed slight relaxations in its lockdown rules and freedom of movement was granted to people while some businesses were allowed to resume work, given everything was contactless.

However, there were also some breaches of the rules as more than 500 people were reprimanded by the police.

Bloomfield also said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just the number of cases or the pattern. But the level to which people are taking seriously the expectations, particularly around physical distancing, hygiene measures and not really squandering the advantage we‚Äôve created for ourselves.‚Äù

We really hope this day reaches all our countries soon so that we can finally win against this novel pandemic."

Hong Kong‚Äôs economy recorded in the first quarter its deepest annual contraction since at least 1974, as the coronavirus pandemic dealt a heavy blow to business activity, already in decline following months of anti-government protest last year.

The outbreak has killed four of Hong Kong‚Äôs 1,041 virus patients, and largely put a brake on protests, while crushing tourism and keeping shoppers off the streets, hitting two key contributors to gross domestic product (GDP).

The Chinese-ruled city‚Äôs success in keeping the virus under control brings some hope of a tentative resumption of activity in coming months, but also fuels the prospect of renewed protest as anger against the government has not dissipated.

‚ÄúSocial distancing will continue to hurt catering and shopping, but another issue is ... I believe there will be more protests over the summer holidays,‚Äù said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING.

It is also unlikely that consumers will have the appetite to spend, given the uncertainty over job prospects in an economy highly exposed to global trade and finance.

With most of the world still battling the virus, tourism is also unlikely to recover in the near term.

‚ÄúHong Kong‚Äôs near-term economic outlook is subject to very high uncertainties, hinging crucially on the evolving global public health and economic situations,‚Äù the government said in a statement accompanying the figures.

The economy shrank by a seasonally adjusted 5.3% in January-March from the previous quarter, versus a revised 0.5% in October-December, advance estimates showed on Monday.

On an annual basis, the economy contracted 8.9%, compared with a revised 3.0% in the fourth quarter of 2019. That was the steepest contraction for a single quarter since records began in 1974, the government said.

The government revised its GDP forecasts for this year to a contraction of 4% to 7%, from a previous estimate ranging from a decline of 1.5% decline to growth of 0.5%.

Financial relief measures for households and businesses are expected to push this year‚Äôs budget deficit to a record HK$276.6 billion ($35.68 billion), equivalent to 9.5% of GDP.

Despite the relief measures, about a quarter of the Asian financial hub‚Äôs roughly 62,400 retail stores are expected to close by year-end, the Hong Kong Retail Management Association said last month."

Hong Kong‚Äôs economy recorded in the first quarter its deepest annual contraction since at least 1974, as the coronavirus pandemic dealt a heavy blow to business activity, already in decline following months of anti-government protest last year.

The outbreak has killed four of Hong Kong‚Äôs 1,041 virus patients, and largely put a brake on protests, while crushing tourism and keeping shoppers off the streets, hitting two key contributors to gross domestic product (GDP).

The Chinese-ruled city‚Äôs success in keeping the virus under control brings some hope of a tentative resumption of activity in coming months, but also fuels the prospect of renewed protest as anger against the government has not dissipated.

‚ÄúSocial distancing will continue to hurt catering and shopping, but another issue is ... I believe there will be more protests over the summer holidays,‚Äù said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING.

It is also unlikely that consumers will have the appetite to spend, given the uncertainty over job prospects in an economy highly exposed to global trade and finance.

With most of the world still battling the virus, tourism is also unlikely to recover in the near term.

‚ÄúHong Kong‚Äôs near-term economic outlook is subject to very high uncertainties, hinging crucially on the evolving global public health and economic situations,‚Äù the government said in a statement accompanying the figures.

The economy shrank by a seasonally adjusted 5.3% in January-March from the previous quarter, versus a revised 0.5% in October-December, advance estimates showed on Monday.

On an annual basis, the economy contracted 8.9%, compared with a revised 3.0% in the fourth quarter of 2019. That was the steepest contraction for a single quarter since records began in 1974, the government said.

The government revised its GDP forecasts for this year to a contraction of 4% to 7%, from a previous estimate ranging from a decline of 1.5% decline to growth of 0.5%.

Financial relief measures for households and businesses are expected to push this year‚Äôs budget deficit to a record HK$276.6 billion ($35.68 billion), equivalent to 9.5% of GDP.

Hong Kong‚Äôs economy recorded in the first quarter its deepest annual contraction since at least 1974, as the coronavirus pandemic dealt a heavy blow to business activity, already in decline following months of anti-government protest last year.

The outbreak has killed four of Hong Kong‚Äôs 1,041 virus patients, and largely put a brake on protests, while crushing tourism and keeping shoppers off the streets, hitting two key contributors to gross domestic product (GDP).

The Chinese-ruled city‚Äôs success in keeping the virus under control brings some hope of a tentative resumption of activity in coming months, but also fuels the prospect of renewed protest as anger against the government has not dissipated.

‚ÄúSocial distancing will continue to hurt catering and shopping, but another issue is ... I believe there will be more protests over the summer holidays,‚Äù said Iris Pang, Greater China economist at ING.

It is also unlikely that consumers will have the appetite to spend, given the uncertainty over job prospects in an economy highly exposed to global trade and finance.

With most of the world still battling the virus, tourism is also unlikely to recover in the near term.

‚ÄúHong Kong‚Äôs near-term economic outlook is subject to very high uncertainties, hinging crucially on the evolving global public health and economic situations,‚Äù the government said in a statement accompanying the figures.

The economy shrank by a seasonally adjusted 5.3% in January-March from the previous quarter, versus a revised 0.5% in October-December, advance estimates showed on Monday.

On an annual basis, the economy contracted 8.9%, compared with a revised 3.0% in the fourth quarter of 2019. That was the steepest contraction for a single quarter since records began in 1974, the government said.

The government revised its GDP forecasts for this year to a contraction of 4% to 7%, from a previous estimate ranging from a decline of 1.5% decline to growth of 0.5%.

Financial relief measures for households and businesses are expected to push this year‚Äôs budget deficit to a record HK$276.6 billion ($35.68 billion), equivalent to 9.5% of GDP.

Despite the relief measures, about a quarter of the Asian financial hub‚Äôs roughly 62,400 retail stores are expected to close by year-end, the Hong Kong Retail Management Association said last month."

It is also unlikely that consumers will have the appetite to spend, given the uncertainty over job prospects in an economy highly exposed to global trade and finance.

With most of the world still battling the virus, tourism is also unlikely to recover in the near term.

‚ÄúHong Kong‚Äôs near-term economic outlook is subject to very high uncertainties, hinging crucially on the evolving global public health and economic situations,‚Äù the government said in a statement accompanying the figures.

The economy shrank by a seasonally adjusted 5.3% in January-March from the previous quarter, versus a revised 0.5% in October-December, advance estimates showed on Monday.

On an annual basis, the economy contracted 8.9%, compared with a revised 3.0% in the fourth quarter of 2019. That was the steepest contraction for a single quarter since records began in 1974, the government said.

The government revised its GDP forecasts for this year to a contraction of 4% to 7%, from a previous estimate ranging from a decline of 1.5% decline to growth of 0.5%.

Financial relief measures for households and businesses are expected to push this year‚Äôs budget deficit to a record HK$276.6 billion ($35.68 billion), equivalent to 9.5% of GDP.

Despite the relief measures, about a quarter of the Asian financial hub‚Äôs roughly 62,400 retail stores are expected to close by year-end, the Hong Kong Retail Management Association said last month."

At the conference, Johnson confirmed the UK‚Äôs pledge of 388 million pounds aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments ‚Äì part of a larger 744 million pounds existing UK aid commitment to help end the pandemic and support the global economy. This includes 250 million pounds for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to develop vaccines against coronavirus ‚Äì the biggest such donation to the fund by any country.

""To win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people, and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine,‚Äù said Johnson.

‚ÄúThe more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It‚Äôs humanity against the virus ‚Äì we are in this together, and together we will prevail,‚Äù he said.

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

UK International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: ‚ÄúIt is only by working together that we will prevent future waves of infection and end this pandemic as quickly as possible.

‚ÄúBy strengthening developing countries‚Äô health systems and working to find a vaccine, the UK is playing its part in stopping the global spread of coronavirus to save lives everywhere and protect our NHS.‚Äù

The conference this week will be followed up by the UK hosting the Global Vaccine Summit on June 4, bringing together countries and organisations to follow the UK‚Äôs lead in investing in the work of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Last week Trevelyan announced a funding pledge equivalent to 330 million pounds a year over the next five years to Gavi. This will help immunise 75 million children in the world‚Äôs poorest countries. PTI AK ZH ZH"

The virtual chat assistant will give responses based on the final guidelines issued by ICMR and also filter old rules that remain valid for handling tests, sample collection, diagnostics, data entry etc related to coronavirus cases.

ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said that it is critical to remain focused on testing, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients in order to lower the growth curve.

He said with the number of on-field testing teams expanding across the nation as part of India's COVID-19 measures, collaboration with IBM will help automate responses from the field and facilitate access to accurate and updated data on the coronavirus diagnostics and reporting.

""This will help augment our teams' response time and allow them to concentrate on priorities like developing and updating testing and treatment protocols and guidance for COVID-19,"" Bhargava said.

Coronavirus cases in the country have increased to 42,533 till date and killed 1,373 people.

""Technology continues to play a significant role in India's fight against COVID-19, and it is crucial to evaluate and leverage the most effective solutions to support these initiatives. The deployment of IBM's chatbot AI platform is aimed to help ICMR effectively manage the process of capturing data relating to COVID-19,"" Ministry of Electronics and IT Additional Secretary Gopalakrishnan S said.

The virtual agent has been deployed on protected pages of the ICMR website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel who are involved with sample collection and testing in hospitals and diagnostic labs, the statement said.

""As India rises to meet the challenge of COVID-19, it is crucial to enable government bodies such as ICMR to utilize data and capabilities effectively for rapid detection and treatment,"" IBM general manager for India and South Asia, Sandip Patel said.

Watson virtual agent will handle text based queries in Hindi and English language.

""Queries will be categorized under various headings such as governance, logistics, data entry and sharing, staff training and testing and for complex questions, pre-defined contact information of ICMR is made available. The virtual agent is also expected to help in on-boarding new data entry operators and staff of diagnostic centres, as the COVID-19 test network expands across the country,"" the statement said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts-833387.html,"The convalescent plasma therapy is no ""magic bullet"" to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

At the conference, Johnson confirmed the UK‚Äôs pledge of 388 million pounds aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments ‚Äì part of a larger 744 million pounds existing UK aid commitment to help end the pandemic and support the global economy. This includes 250 million pounds for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to develop vaccines against coronavirus ‚Äì the biggest such donation to the fund by any country.

""To win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people, and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine,‚Äù said Johnson.

‚ÄúThe more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It‚Äôs humanity against the virus ‚Äì we are in this together, and together we will prevail,‚Äù he said.

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

UK International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: ‚ÄúIt is only by working together that we will prevent future waves of infection and end this pandemic as quickly as possible.

‚ÄúBy strengthening developing countries‚Äô health systems and working to find a vaccine, the UK is playing its part in stopping the global spread of coronavirus to save lives everywhere and protect our NHS.‚Äù

The conference this week will be followed up by the UK hosting the Global Vaccine Summit on June 4, bringing together countries and organisations to follow the UK‚Äôs lead in investing in the work of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Last week Trevelyan announced a funding pledge equivalent to 330 million pounds a year over the next five years to Gavi. This will help immunise 75 million children in the world‚Äôs poorest countries. PTI AK ZH ZH"

The virtual chat assistant will give responses based on the final guidelines issued by ICMR and also filter old rules that remain valid for handling tests, sample collection, diagnostics, data entry etc related to coronavirus cases.

ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said that it is critical to remain focused on testing, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients in order to lower the growth curve.

He said with the number of on-field testing teams expanding across the nation as part of India's COVID-19 measures, collaboration with IBM will help automate responses from the field and facilitate access to accurate and updated data on the coronavirus diagnostics and reporting.

""This will help augment our teams' response time and allow them to concentrate on priorities like developing and updating testing and treatment protocols and guidance for COVID-19,"" Bhargava said.

Coronavirus cases in the country have increased to 42,533 till date and killed 1,373 people.

""Technology continues to play a significant role in India's fight against COVID-19, and it is crucial to evaluate and leverage the most effective solutions to support these initiatives. The deployment of IBM's chatbot AI platform is aimed to help ICMR effectively manage the process of capturing data relating to COVID-19,"" Ministry of Electronics and IT Additional Secretary Gopalakrishnan S said.

The virtual agent has been deployed on protected pages of the ICMR website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel who are involved with sample collection and testing in hospitals and diagnostic labs, the statement said.

""As India rises to meet the challenge of COVID-19, it is crucial to enable government bodies such as ICMR to utilize data and capabilities effectively for rapid detection and treatment,"" IBM general manager for India and South Asia, Sandip Patel said.

Watson virtual agent will handle text based queries in Hindi and English language.

""Queries will be categorized under various headings such as governance, logistics, data entry and sharing, staff training and testing and for complex questions, pre-defined contact information of ICMR is made available.

https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts-833387.html,"The convalescent plasma therapy is no ""magic bullet"" to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

At the conference, Johnson confirmed the UK‚Äôs pledge of 388 million pounds aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments ‚Äì part of a larger 744 million pounds existing UK aid commitment to help end the pandemic and support the global economy. This includes 250 million pounds for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to develop vaccines against coronavirus ‚Äì the biggest such donation to the fund by any country.

""To win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people, and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine,‚Äù said Johnson.

‚ÄúThe more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It‚Äôs humanity against the virus ‚Äì we are in this together, and together we will prevail,‚Äù he said.

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

UK International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: ‚ÄúIt is only by working together that we will prevent future waves of infection and end this pandemic as quickly as possible.

‚ÄúBy strengthening developing countries‚Äô health systems and working to find a vaccine, the UK is playing its part in stopping the global spread of coronavirus to save lives everywhere and protect our NHS.‚Äù

The conference this week will be followed up by the UK hosting the Global Vaccine Summit on June 4, bringing together countries and organisations to follow the UK‚Äôs lead in investing in the work of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Last week Trevelyan announced a funding pledge equivalent to 330 million pounds a year over the next five years to Gavi. This will help immunise 75 million children in the world‚Äôs poorest countries. PTI AK ZH ZH"

The virtual chat assistant will give responses based on the final guidelines issued by ICMR and also filter old rules that remain valid for handling tests, sample collection, diagnostics, data entry etc related to coronavirus cases.

ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said that it is critical to remain focused on testing, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients in order to lower the growth curve.

He said with the number of on-field testing teams expanding across the nation as part of India's COVID-19 measures, collaboration with IBM will help automate responses from the field and facilitate access to accurate and updated data on the coronavirus diagnostics and reporting.

""This will help augment our teams' response time and allow them to concentrate on priorities like developing and updating testing and treatment protocols and guidance for COVID-19,"" Bhargava said.

Coronavirus cases in the country have increased to 42,533 till date and killed 1,373 people.

""Technology continues to play a significant role in India's fight against COVID-19, and it is crucial to evaluate and leverage the most effective solutions to support these initiatives. The deployment of IBM's chatbot AI platform is aimed to help ICMR effectively manage the process of capturing data relating to COVID-19,"" Ministry of Electronics and IT Additional Secretary Gopalakrishnan S said.

The virtual agent has been deployed on protected pages of the ICMR website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel who are involved with sample collection and testing in hospitals and diagnostic labs, the statement said.

""As India rises to meet the challenge of COVID-19, it is crucial to enable government bodies such as ICMR to utilize data and capabilities effectively for rapid detection and treatment,"" IBM general manager for India and South Asia, Sandip Patel said.

Watson virtual agent will handle text based queries in Hindi and English language.

""Queries will be categorized under various headings such as governance, logistics, data entry and sharing, staff training and testing and for complex questions, pre-defined contact information of ICMR is made available.

https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts-833387.html,"The convalescent plasma therapy is no ""magic bullet"" to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

At the conference, Johnson confirmed the UK‚Äôs pledge of 388 million pounds aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments ‚Äì part of a larger 744 million pounds existing UK aid commitment to help end the pandemic and support the global economy. This includes 250 million pounds for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to develop vaccines against coronavirus ‚Äì the biggest such donation to the fund by any country.

""To win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people, and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine,‚Äù said Johnson.

‚ÄúThe more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It‚Äôs humanity against the virus ‚Äì we are in this together, and together we will prevail,‚Äù he said.

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

UK International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: ‚ÄúIt is only by working together that we will prevent future waves of infection and end this pandemic as quickly as possible.

‚ÄúBy strengthening developing countries‚Äô health systems and working to find a vaccine, the UK is playing its part in stopping the global spread of coronavirus to save lives everywhere and protect our NHS.‚Äù

The conference this week will be followed up by the UK hosting the Global Vaccine Summit on June 4, bringing together countries and organisations to follow the UK‚Äôs lead in investing in the work of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Last week Trevelyan announced a funding pledge equivalent to 330 million pounds a year over the next five years to Gavi. This will help immunise 75 million children in the world‚Äôs poorest countries. PTI AK ZH ZH"

The virtual chat assistant will give responses based on the final guidelines issued by ICMR and also filter old rules that remain valid for handling tests, sample collection, diagnostics, data entry etc related to coronavirus cases.

ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said that it is critical to remain focused on testing, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients in order to lower the growth curve.

He said with the number of on-field testing teams expanding across the nation as part of India's COVID-19 measures, collaboration with IBM will help automate responses from the field and facilitate access to accurate and updated data on the coronavirus diagnostics and reporting.

""This will help augment our teams' response time and allow them to concentrate on priorities like developing and updating testing and treatment protocols and guidance for COVID-19,"" Bhargava said.

Coronavirus cases in the country have increased to 42,533 till date and killed 1,373 people.

""Technology continues to play a significant role in India's fight against COVID-19, and it is crucial to evaluate and leverage the most effective solutions to support these initiatives. The deployment of IBM's chatbot AI platform is aimed to help ICMR effectively manage the process of capturing data relating to COVID-19,"" Ministry of Electronics and IT Additional Secretary Gopalakrishnan S said.

The virtual agent has been deployed on protected pages of the ICMR website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel who are involved with sample collection and testing in hospitals and diagnostic labs, the statement said.

""As India rises to meet the challenge of COVID-19, it is crucial to enable government bodies such as ICMR to utilize data and capabilities effectively for rapid detection and treatment,"" IBM general manager for India and South Asia, Sandip Patel said.

Watson virtual agent will handle text based queries in Hindi and English language.

""Queries will be categorized under various headings such as governance, logistics, data entry and sharing, staff training and testing and for complex questions, pre-defined contact information of ICMR is made available. The virtual agent is also expected to help in on-boarding new data entry operators and staff of diagnostic centres, as the COVID-19 test network expands across the country,"" the statement said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts-833387.html,"The convalescent plasma therapy is no ""magic bullet"" to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

At the conference, Johnson confirmed the UK‚Äôs pledge of 388 million pounds aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments ‚Äì part of a larger 744 million pounds existing UK aid commitment to help end the pandemic and support the global economy. This includes 250 million pounds for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to develop vaccines against coronavirus ‚Äì the biggest such donation to the fund by any country.

""To win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people, and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine,‚Äù said Johnson.

‚ÄúThe more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It‚Äôs humanity against the virus ‚Äì we are in this together, and together we will prevail,‚Äù he said.

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

UK International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: ‚ÄúIt is only by working together that we will prevent future waves of infection and end this pandemic as quickly as possible.

‚ÄúBy strengthening developing countries‚Äô health systems and working to find a vaccine, the UK is playing its part in stopping the global spread of coronavirus to save lives everywhere and protect our NHS.‚Äù

The conference this week will be followed up by the UK hosting the Global Vaccine Summit on June 4, bringing together countries and organisations to follow the UK‚Äôs lead in investing in the work of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Last week Trevelyan announced a funding pledge equivalent to 330 million pounds a year over the next five years to Gavi. This will help immunise 75 million children in the world‚Äôs poorest countries. PTI AK ZH ZH"

The virtual chat assistant will give responses based on the final guidelines issued by ICMR and also filter old rules that remain valid for handling tests, sample collection, diagnostics, data entry etc related to coronavirus cases.

ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said that it is critical to remain focused on testing, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients in order to lower the growth curve.

He said with the number of on-field testing teams expanding across the nation as part of India's COVID-19 measures, collaboration with IBM will help automate responses from the field and facilitate access to accurate and updated data on the coronavirus diagnostics and reporting.

""This will help augment our teams' response time and allow them to concentrate on priorities like developing and updating testing and treatment protocols and guidance for COVID-19,"" Bhargava said.

Coronavirus cases in the country have increased to 42,533 till date and killed 1,373 people.

""Technology continues to play a significant role in India's fight against COVID-19, and it is crucial to evaluate and leverage the most effective solutions to support these initiatives. The deployment of IBM's chatbot AI platform is aimed to help ICMR effectively manage the process of capturing data relating to COVID-19,"" Ministry of Electronics and IT Additional Secretary Gopalakrishnan S said.

The virtual agent has been deployed on protected pages of the ICMR website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel who are involved with sample collection and testing in hospitals and diagnostic labs, the statement said.

""As India rises to meet the challenge of COVID-19, it is crucial to enable government bodies such as ICMR to utilize data and capabilities effectively for rapid detection and treatment,"" IBM general manager for India and South Asia, Sandip Patel said.

Watson virtual agent will handle text based queries in Hindi and English language.

""Queries will be categorized under various headings such as governance, logistics, data entry and sharing, staff training and testing and for complex questions, pre-defined contact information of ICMR is made available. The virtual agent is also expected to help in on-boarding new data entry operators and staff of diagnostic centres, as the COVID-19 test network expands across the country,"" the statement said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts-833387.html,"The convalescent plasma therapy is no ""magic bullet"" to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

At the conference, Johnson confirmed the UK‚Äôs pledge of 388 million pounds aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments ‚Äì part of a larger 744 million pounds existing UK aid commitment to help end the pandemic and support the global economy. This includes 250 million pounds for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to develop vaccines against coronavirus ‚Äì the biggest such donation to the fund by any country.

""To win this battle, we must work together to build an impregnable shield around all our people, and that can only be achieved by developing and mass producing a vaccine,‚Äù said Johnson.

‚ÄúThe more we pull together and share our expertise, the faster our scientists will succeed. The race to discover the vaccine to defeat this virus is not a competition between countries, but the most urgent shared endeavour of our lifetimes. It‚Äôs humanity against the virus ‚Äì we are in this together, and together we will prevail,‚Äù he said.

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

UK International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: ‚ÄúIt is only by working together that we will prevent future waves of infection and end this pandemic as quickly as possible.

‚ÄúBy strengthening developing countries‚Äô health systems and working to find a vaccine, the UK is playing its part in stopping the global spread of coronavirus to save lives everywhere and protect our NHS.‚Äù

The conference this week will be followed up by the UK hosting the Global Vaccine Summit on June 4, bringing together countries and organisations to follow the UK‚Äôs lead in investing in the work of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.

Last week Trevelyan announced a funding pledge equivalent to 330 million pounds a year over the next five years to Gavi. This will help immunise 75 million children in the world‚Äôs poorest countries. PTI AK ZH ZH"
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-icmr-deploys-ibms-watson-to-expedite-responses-from-testing-833363.html,"Indian Council of Medical Research has deployed IBM's artificial intelligence tool Watson Assistant to expedite and simplify responses from testing to provide accurate and updated data on COVID-19, the IT company said on Monday.

The virtual chat assistant will give responses based on the final guidelines issued by ICMR and also filter old rules that remain valid for handling tests, sample collection, diagnostics, data entry etc related to coronavirus cases.

ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said that it is critical to remain focused on testing, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients in order to lower the growth curve.

He said with the number of on-field testing teams expanding across the nation as part of India's COVID-19 measures, collaboration with IBM will help automate responses from the field and facilitate access to accurate and updated data on the coronavirus diagnostics and reporting.

""This will help augment our teams' response time and allow them to concentrate on priorities like developing and updating testing and treatment protocols and guidance for COVID-19,"" Bhargava said.

Coronavirus cases in the country have increased to 42,533 till date and killed 1,373 people.

""Technology continues to play a significant role in India's fight against COVID-19, and it is crucial to evaluate and leverage the most effective solutions to support these initiatives. The deployment of IBM's chatbot AI platform is aimed to help ICMR effectively manage the process of capturing data relating to COVID-19,"" Ministry of Electronics and IT Additional Secretary Gopalakrishnan S said.

The virtual agent has been deployed on protected pages of the ICMR website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel who are involved with sample collection and testing in hospitals and diagnostic labs, the statement said.

""As India rises to meet the challenge of COVID-19, it is crucial to enable government bodies such as ICMR to utilize data and capabilities effectively for rapid detection and treatment,"" IBM general manager for India and South Asia, Sandip Patel said.

Watson virtual agent will handle text based queries in Hindi and English language.

""Queries will be categorized under various headings such as governance, logistics, data entry and sharing, staff training and testing and for complex questions, pre-defined contact information of ICMR is made available. The virtual agent is also expected to help in on-boarding new data entry operators and staff of diagnostic centres, as the COVID-19 test network expands across the country,"" the statement said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts-833387.html,"The convalescent plasma therapy is no ""magic bullet"" to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last month called the online pledging conference ""a real marathon"", saying a vaccine to the respiratory disease COVID-19 was needed ""in every corner of the world ... at affordable prices.""

The event starts at 1300 GMT on Monday but donation figures may not be known immediately. It is unclear how much of the money which will be pledged represents new funding, as financial commitments made earlier this year will also be included.

Saudi Arabia, the current chair of the Group of 20 industrialised countries, has pledged $500 million.

Some EU officials have raised concerns about countries counting in money already pledged earlier this year.

The 7.5 billion euro target is an initial figure. Von der Leyen has said countries will need more money over time.

Liquor buyers who had lined before the shops since dawn used innovative methods like placing their bags and caps in the boxes marked to remain in the queue. Some even offered prayers before the shops and thanked God for hearing their prayers.

As the shops opened, buyers stood in place of their bags and caps.

Since the lockdown, the sale of liquor was banned. It had led to many, who succeded in hoarding stocks prior to lockdown, selling them at a higher price than actual costs.

Illegal sale of liquor too had increased and many were forced to meet their needs by consuming illicit liquor despite it being a threat to health.

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

""Accordingly, we now expect the Indian GDP (gross domestic product) to contract by 16-20 per cent in Q1FY21 (first quarter of 2020-21), which implies that a full-year contraction of 1-2 per cent is inevitable,"" it said.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

UK International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: ‚ÄúIt is only by working together that we will prevent future waves of infection and end this pandemic as quickly as possible.

‚ÄúBy strengthening developing countries‚Äô health systems and working to find a vaccine, the UK is playing its part in stopping the global spread of coronavirus to save lives everywhere and protect our NHS.‚Äù

The virtual chat assistant will give responses based on the final guidelines issued by ICMR and also filter old rules that remain valid for handling tests, sample collection, diagnostics, data entry etc related to coronavirus cases.

ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said that it is critical to remain focused on testing, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients in order to lower the growth curve.

He said with the number of on-field testing teams expanding across the nation as part of India's COVID-19 measures, collaboration with IBM will help automate responses from the field and facilitate access to accurate and updated data on the coronavirus diagnostics and reporting.

""This will help augment our teams' response time and allow them to concentrate on priorities like developing and updating testing and treatment protocols and guidance for COVID-19,"" Bhargava said.

Coronavirus cases in the country have increased to 42,533 till date and killed 1,373 people.

""Technology continues to play a significant role in India's fight against COVID-19, and it is crucial to evaluate and leverage the most effective solutions to support these initiatives. The deployment of IBM's chatbot AI platform is aimed to help ICMR effectively manage the process of capturing data relating to COVID-19,"" Ministry of Electronics and IT Additional Secretary Gopalakrishnan S said.

The virtual agent has been deployed on protected pages of the ICMR website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel who are involved with sample collection and testing in hospitals and diagnostic labs, the statement said.

""As India rises to meet the challenge of COVID-19, it is crucial to enable government bodies such as ICMR to utilize data and capabilities effectively for rapid detection and treatment,"" IBM general manager for India and South Asia, Sandip Patel said.

Watson virtual agent will handle text based queries in Hindi and English language.

""Queries will be categorized under various headings such as governance, logistics, data entry and sharing, staff training and testing and for complex questions, pre-defined contact information of ICMR is made available. The virtual agent is also expected to help in on-boarding new data entry operators and staff of diagnostic centres, as the COVID-19 test network expands across the country,"" the statement said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts-833387.html,"The convalescent plasma therapy is no ""magic bullet"" to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-icmr-deploys-ibms-watson-to-expedite-responses-from-testing-833363.html,"Indian Council of Medical Research has deployed IBM's artificial intelligence tool Watson Assistant to expedite and simplify responses from testing to provide accurate and updated data on COVID-19, the IT company said on Monday.

The virtual chat assistant will give responses based on the final guidelines issued by ICMR and also filter old rules that remain valid for handling tests, sample collection, diagnostics, data entry etc related to coronavirus cases.

ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said that it is critical to remain focused on testing, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients in order to lower the growth curve.

He said with the number of on-field testing teams expanding across the nation as part of India's COVID-19 measures, collaboration with IBM will help automate responses from the field and facilitate access to accurate and updated data on the coronavirus diagnostics and reporting.

""This will help augment our teams' response time and allow them to concentrate on priorities like developing and updating testing and treatment protocols and guidance for COVID-19,"" Bhargava said.

Coronavirus cases in the country have increased to 42,533 till date and killed 1,373 people.

""Technology continues to play a significant role in India's fight against COVID-19, and it is crucial to evaluate and leverage the most effective solutions to support these initiatives. The deployment of IBM's chatbot AI platform is aimed to help ICMR effectively manage the process of capturing data relating to COVID-19,"" Ministry of Electronics and IT Additional Secretary Gopalakrishnan S said.

The virtual agent has been deployed on protected pages of the ICMR website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel who are involved with sample collection and testing in hospitals and diagnostic labs, the statement said.

""As India rises to meet the challenge of COVID-19, it is crucial to enable government bodies such as ICMR to utilize data and capabilities effectively for rapid detection and treatment,"" IBM general manager for India and South Asia, Sandip Patel said.

Watson virtual agent will handle text based queries in Hindi and English language.

""Queries will be categorized under various headings such as governance, logistics, data entry and sharing, staff training and testing and for complex questions, pre-defined contact information of ICMR is made available. The virtual agent is also expected to help in on-boarding new data entry operators and staff of diagnostic centres, as the COVID-19 test network expands across the country,"" the statement said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts-833387.html,"The convalescent plasma therapy is no ""magic bullet"" to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

https://www.deccanherald.com/national/covid-19-icmr-deploys-ibms-watson-to-expedite-responses-from-testing-833363.html,"Indian Council of Medical Research has deployed IBM's artificial intelligence tool Watson Assistant to expedite and simplify responses from testing to provide accurate and updated data on COVID-19, the IT company said on Monday.

The virtual chat assistant will give responses based on the final guidelines issued by ICMR and also filter old rules that remain valid for handling tests, sample collection, diagnostics, data entry etc related to coronavirus cases.

ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said that it is critical to remain focused on testing, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients in order to lower the growth curve.

He said with the number of on-field testing teams expanding across the nation as part of India's COVID-19 measures, collaboration with IBM will help automate responses from the field and facilitate access to accurate and updated data on the coronavirus diagnostics and reporting.

""This will help augment our teams' response time and allow them to concentrate on priorities like developing and updating testing and treatment protocols and guidance for COVID-19,"" Bhargava said.

Coronavirus cases in the country have increased to 42,533 till date and killed 1,373 people.

""Technology continues to play a significant role in India's fight against COVID-19, and it is crucial to evaluate and leverage the most effective solutions to support these initiatives. The deployment of IBM's chatbot AI platform is aimed to help ICMR effectively manage the process of capturing data relating to COVID-19,"" Ministry of Electronics and IT Additional Secretary Gopalakrishnan S said.

The virtual agent has been deployed on protected pages of the ICMR website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel who are involved with sample collection and testing in hospitals and diagnostic labs, the statement said.

""As India rises to meet the challenge of COVID-19, it is crucial to enable government bodies such as ICMR to utilize data and capabilities effectively for rapid detection and treatment,"" IBM general manager for India and South Asia, Sandip Patel said.

Watson virtual agent will handle text based queries in Hindi and English language.

""Queries will be categorized under various headings such as governance, logistics, data entry and sharing, staff training and testing and for complex questions, pre-defined contact information of ICMR is made available. The virtual agent is also expected to help in on-boarding new data entry operators and staff of diagnostic centres, as the COVID-19 test network expands across the country,"" the statement said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts-833387.html,"The convalescent plasma therapy is no ""magic bullet"" to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

Liquor buyers who had lined before the shops since dawn used innovative methods like placing their bags and caps in the boxes marked to remain in the queue. Some even offered prayers before the shops and thanked God for hearing their prayers.

As the shops opened, buyers stood in place of their bags and caps.

Since the lockdown, the sale of liquor was banned. It had led to many, who succeded in hoarding stocks prior to lockdown, selling them at a higher price than actual costs.

Illegal sale of liquor too had increased and many were forced to meet their needs by consuming illicit liquor despite it being a threat to health.

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

""While the graded relaxations announced by the government will permit the resumption of economic activity, the relatively stringent norms in major urban centres will result in the pace of activity remaining constrained,"" the agency said.

It said there is a likelihood of mismatches in labour availability and sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, trade, hotels and transport, will drag down growth.

""Accordingly, we now expect the Indian GDP (gross domestic product) to contract by 16-20 per cent in Q1FY21 (first quarter of 2020-21), which implies that a full-year contraction of 1-2 per cent is inevitable,"" it said.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said that it is critical to remain focused on testing, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients in order to lower the growth curve.

He said with the number of on-field testing teams expanding across the nation as part of India's COVID-19 measures, collaboration with IBM will help automate responses from the field and facilitate access to accurate and updated data on the coronavirus diagnostics and reporting.

""This will help augment our teams' response time and allow them to concentrate on priorities like developing and updating testing and treatment protocols and guidance for COVID-19,"" Bhargava said.

Coronavirus cases in the country have increased to 42,533 till date and killed 1,373 people.

""Technology continues to play a significant role in India's fight against COVID-19, and it is crucial to evaluate and leverage the most effective solutions to support these initiatives. The deployment of IBM's chatbot AI platform is aimed to help ICMR effectively manage the process of capturing data relating to COVID-19,"" Ministry of Electronics and IT Additional Secretary Gopalakrishnan S said.

The virtual agent has been deployed on protected pages of the ICMR website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel who are involved with sample collection and testing in hospitals and diagnostic labs, the statement said.

""As India rises to meet the challenge of COVID-19, it is crucial to enable government bodies such as ICMR to utilize data and capabilities effectively for rapid detection and treatment,"" IBM general manager for India and South Asia, Sandip Patel said.

Watson virtual agent will handle text based queries in Hindi and English language.

""Queries will be categorized under various headings such as governance, logistics, data entry and sharing, staff training and testing and for complex questions, pre-defined contact information of ICMR is made available. The virtual agent is also expected to help in on-boarding new data entry operators and staff of diagnostic centres, as the COVID-19 test network expands across the country,"" the statement said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts-833387.html,"The convalescent plasma therapy is no ""magic bullet"" to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

""This will help augment our teams' response time and allow them to concentrate on priorities like developing and updating testing and treatment protocols and guidance for COVID-19,"" Bhargava said.

Coronavirus cases in the country have increased to 42,533 till date and killed 1,373 people.

""Technology continues to play a significant role in India's fight against COVID-19, and it is crucial to evaluate and leverage the most effective solutions to support these initiatives. The deployment of IBM's chatbot AI platform is aimed to help ICMR effectively manage the process of capturing data relating to COVID-19,"" Ministry of Electronics and IT Additional Secretary Gopalakrishnan S said.

The virtual agent has been deployed on protected pages of the ICMR website that can be accessed only by authorized personnel who are involved with sample collection and testing in hospitals and diagnostic labs, the statement said.

""As India rises to meet the challenge of COVID-19, it is crucial to enable government bodies such as ICMR to utilize data and capabilities effectively for rapid detection and treatment,"" IBM general manager for India and South Asia, Sandip Patel said.

Watson virtual agent will handle text based queries in Hindi and English language.

""Queries will be categorized under various headings such as governance, logistics, data entry and sharing, staff training and testing and for complex questions, pre-defined contact information of ICMR is made available. The virtual agent is also expected to help in on-boarding new data entry operators and staff of diagnostic centres, as the COVID-19 test network expands across the country,"" the statement said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts-833387.html,"The convalescent plasma therapy is no ""magic bullet"" to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts-833387.html,"The convalescent plasma therapy is no ""magic bullet"" to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

https://www.deccanherald.com/science-and-environment/plasma-therapy-no-magic-bullet-against-covid-19-need-large-scale-trials-to-prove-efficacy-experts-833387.html,"The convalescent plasma therapy is no ""magic bullet"" to deal with coronavirus, and only large-scale controlled trials can ascertain its efficacy as part of the treatment strategy, top medical experts said on Monday, even as several states are considering the use of the therapy to treat critically-ill COVID-19 patients.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

Saudi Arabia, the current chair of the Group of 20 industrialised countries, has pledged $500 million.

Some EU officials have raised concerns about countries counting in money already pledged earlier this year.

The 7.5 billion euro target is an initial figure. Von der Leyen has said countries will need more money over time.

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

""While the graded relaxations announced by the government will permit the resumption of economic activity, the relatively stringent norms in major urban centres will result in the pace of activity remaining constrained,"" the agency said.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

""While the graded relaxations announced by the government will permit the resumption of economic activity, the relatively stringent norms in major urban centres will result in the pace of activity remaining constrained,"" the agency said.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

""While the graded relaxations announced by the government will permit the resumption of economic activity, the relatively stringent norms in major urban centres will result in the pace of activity remaining constrained,"" the agency said.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

""While the graded relaxations announced by the government will permit the resumption of economic activity, the relatively stringent norms in major urban centres will result in the pace of activity remaining constrained,"" the agency said.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Prof Sule Aker, President of the WAPC, advised fellow media persons to remain careful and disseminate authentic news about the disease, a statement said.

She also urged all governments and media houses to keep the interest of the media persons at the top of their minds.

Kishor Shrestha, Secretary General of the WAPC and Chairman of the Nepal Press Council, gave details of the work done by the council in his country.

He also urged all governments to come to the aid of the journalists who are fighting the ""war"" against the virus like scores of health professionals and others.

Members from Northern Cyprus, Turkey, Nepal, Azerbaijan, India, Tanzania, Kenya, Iraq, Kosovo and many other countries participated in the conference.

Concluding the conference, Aker said there is a universal acknowledgement of the need for a free and unrestricted flow of information beyond the boundaries with the media embracing the role of a public trust.

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

""While the graded relaxations announced by the government will permit the resumption of economic activity, the relatively stringent norms in major urban centres will result in the pace of activity remaining constrained,"" the agency said.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

Prof Sule Aker, President of the WAPC, advised fellow media persons to remain careful and disseminate authentic news about the disease, a statement said.

She also urged all governments and media houses to keep the interest of the media persons at the top of their minds.

Kishor Shrestha, Secretary General of the WAPC and Chairman of the Nepal Press Council, gave details of the work done by the council in his country.

He also urged all governments to come to the aid of the journalists who are fighting the ""war"" against the virus like scores of health professionals and others.

Members from Northern Cyprus, Turkey, Nepal, Azerbaijan, India, Tanzania, Kenya, Iraq, Kosovo and many other countries participated in the conference.

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

Prof Sule Aker, President of the WAPC, advised fellow media persons to remain careful and disseminate authentic news about the disease, a statement said.

She also urged all governments and media houses to keep the interest of the media persons at the top of their minds.

Kishor Shrestha, Secretary General of the WAPC and Chairman of the Nepal Press Council, gave details of the work done by the council in his country.

He also urged all governments to come to the aid of the journalists who are fighting the ""war"" against the virus like scores of health professionals and others.

Members from Northern Cyprus, Turkey, Nepal, Azerbaijan, India, Tanzania, Kenya, Iraq, Kosovo and many other countries participated in the conference.

Concluding the conference, Aker said there is a universal acknowledgement of the need for a free and unrestricted flow of information beyond the boundaries with the media embracing the role of a public trust.

United Nations General Assembly declared May 3 to be World Press Freedom Day to raise awareness of the importance of freedom of the press and remind governments of their duty to respect and uphold the right to freedom of expression enshrined under Article 19 of the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

Saudi Arabia, the current chair of the Group of 20 industrialised countries, has pledged $500 million.

Some EU officials have raised concerns about countries counting in money already pledged earlier this year.

The 7.5 billion euro target is an initial figure. Von der Leyen has said countries will need more money over time.

Since the lockdown, the sale of liquor was banned. It had led to many, who succeded in hoarding stocks prior to lockdown, selling them at a higher price than actual costs.

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

""While the graded relaxations announced by the government will permit the resumption of economic activity, the relatively stringent norms in major urban centres will result in the pace of activity remaining constrained,"" the agency said.

""Accordingly, we now expect the Indian GDP (gross domestic product) to contract by 16-20 per cent in Q1FY21 (first quarter of 2020-21), which implies that a full-year contraction of 1-2 per cent is inevitable,"" it said.

A slew of watchers have been forecasting for a heavy impact on the already sagging growth -- India was supposed to grow at a decadal low in 2019-20 as per official estimates -- because of the COVID-19 pandemic that has chilled all activity.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

""While the graded relaxations announced by the government will permit the resumption of economic activity, the relatively stringent norms in major urban centres will result in the pace of activity remaining constrained,"" the agency said.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

https://www.deccanherald.com/international/coronavirus-us-arms-makers-and-medical-device-firms-team-up-to-make-ventilators-833389.html,"U.S. weapons makers have teamed up with medical device companies to increase the supply of ventilators that can be used to combat the coronavirus pandemic, people working on the project said.

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

""While the graded relaxations announced by the government will permit the resumption of economic activity, the relatively stringent norms in major urban centres will result in the pace of activity remaining constrained,"" the agency said.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last month called the online pledging conference ""a real marathon"", saying a vaccine to the respiratory disease COVID-19 was needed ""in every corner of the world ... at affordable prices.""

The event starts at 1300 GMT on Monday but donation figures may not be known immediately. It is unclear how much of the money which will be pledged represents new funding, as financial commitments made earlier this year will also be included.

Saudi Arabia, the current chair of the Group of 20 industrialised countries, has pledged $500 million.

Some EU officials have raised concerns about countries counting in money already pledged earlier this year.

The 7.5 billion euro target is an initial figure. Von der Leyen has said countries will need more money over time.

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

""While the graded relaxations announced by the government will permit the resumption of economic activity, the relatively stringent norms in major urban centres will result in the pace of activity remaining constrained,"" the agency said.

""Accordingly, we now expect the Indian GDP (gross domestic product) to contract by 16-20 per cent in Q1FY21 (first quarter of 2020-21), which implies that a full-year contraction of 1-2 per cent is inevitable,"" it said.

A slew of watchers have been forecasting for a heavy impact on the already sagging growth -- India was supposed to grow at a decadal low in 2019-20 as per official estimates -- because of the COVID-19 pandemic that has chilled all activity.

The government has already announced a Rs 1.7-lakh crore package to fight the COVID-19 crisis, which many feel is not sufficient.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

UK International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: ‚ÄúIt is only by working together that we will prevent future waves of infection and end this pandemic as quickly as possible.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last month called the online pledging conference ""a real marathon"", saying a vaccine to the respiratory disease COVID-19 was needed ""in every corner of the world ... at affordable prices.""

The event starts at 1300 GMT on Monday but donation figures may not be known immediately. It is unclear how much of the money which will be pledged represents new funding, as financial commitments made earlier this year will also be included.

Saudi Arabia, the current chair of the Group of 20 industrialised countries, has pledged $500 million.

Some EU officials have raised concerns about countries counting in money already pledged earlier this year.

The 7.5 billion euro target is an initial figure. Von der Leyen has said countries will need more money over time.

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

At the conference, Johnson confirmed the UK‚Äôs pledge of 388 million pounds aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments ‚Äì part of a larger 744 million pounds existing UK aid commitment to help end the pandemic and support the global economy. This includes 250 million pounds for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to develop vaccines against coronavirus ‚Äì the biggest such donation to the fund by any country.

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

UK International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: ‚ÄúIt is only by working together that we will prevent future waves of infection and end this pandemic as quickly as possible.

He said with the number of on-field testing teams expanding across the nation as part of India's COVID-19 measures, collaboration with IBM will help automate responses from the field and facilitate access to accurate and updated data on the coronavirus diagnostics and reporting.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

Organised by the European Union, non-EU states Britain and Norway, and Japan, Canada and Saudi Arabia, leaders aim to raise funds over several weeks or months, building on efforts by the World Bank, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and wealthy individuals.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last month called the online pledging conference ""a real marathon"", saying a vaccine to the respiratory disease COVID-19 was needed ""in every corner of the world ... at affordable prices.""

The event starts at 1300 GMT on Monday but donation figures may not be known immediately. It is unclear how much of the money which will be pledged represents new funding, as financial commitments made earlier this year will also be included.

Saudi Arabia, the current chair of the Group of 20 industrialised countries, has pledged $500 million.

Some EU officials have raised concerns about countries counting in money already pledged earlier this year.

The 7.5 billion euro target is an initial figure. Von der Leyen has said countries will need more money over time.

Britain will hold another online donor summit on June 4."

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

UK International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: ‚ÄúIt is only by working together that we will prevent future waves of infection and end this pandemic as quickly as possible.

He said with the number of on-field testing teams expanding across the nation as part of India's COVID-19 measures, collaboration with IBM will help automate responses from the field and facilitate access to accurate and updated data on the coronavirus diagnostics and reporting.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

At the conference, Johnson confirmed the UK‚Äôs pledge of 388 million pounds aid funding for research into vaccines, tests and treatments ‚Äì part of a larger 744 million pounds existing UK aid commitment to help end the pandemic and support the global economy. This includes 250 million pounds for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to develop vaccines against coronavirus ‚Äì the biggest such donation to the fund by any country.

The conference was updated on the progress at pace on vaccine development, with the University of Oxford and pharmaceutical major AstraZeneca announcing a partnership to support large-scale manufacture and potential distribution of a vaccine currently being trialled by the university.

The UK highlighted that tackling coronavirus globally is crucial to preventing a second wave of the virus re-emerging in Britain, which would put even further pressure on the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). It will also ensure that life-saving vaccines, treatments and diagnostic tests are available as soon as possible.

UK International Development Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan, said: ‚ÄúIt is only by working together that we will prevent future waves of infection and end this pandemic as quickly as possible.

ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said that it is critical to remain focused on testing, diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus patients in order to lower the growth curve.

He said with the number of on-field testing teams expanding across the nation as part of India's COVID-19 measures, collaboration with IBM will help automate responses from the field and facilitate access to accurate and updated data on the coronavirus diagnostics and reporting.

The therapy involves taking antibodies from the blood of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 and transfusing those antibodies into an active coronavirus patient to help kickstart the immune system to fight the infection.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The Health Ministry last week warned against its use, saying that the plasma therapy for treatment of coronavirus patients is at an experimental stage and has the potential to cause life-threatening complications.

However, some state governments, including Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi have shown keenness for plasma therapy treatment, and the Centre has permitted few states to perform plasma therapy on a limited number of COVID-19 patients.

Top medical experts feel it should not be looked upon as something that could make a ""huge difference"" in the treatment of COVID-19 and only randomised controlled trials can prove its efficacy as an important treatment strategy.

For latest updates and live news on coronavirus, click here

Director of AIIMS, Delhi, Randeep Guleria said there have been very few convalescent plasma therapy trials as far as COVID-19 is concerned, and only in very few patients it has shown some benefit.

""It is just one part of the treatment strategy. It helps improve the person‚Äôs own immunity by giving what we call passive immunity because the antibodies in the plasma enter the blood and try to help fight the virus in the afflicted individual. It is not something which will dramatically make a difference,"" Guleria told PTI.

There is no study to suggest that ""it is a magic bullet"" or it will make a dramatic difference, but it is part of the armamentarium of treatment that physicians have along with other drugs, the senior pulmonologist said.

ICMR has already called for a proposal and a large number of institutes have enrolled for the convalescent plasma therapy trials, he said.

""Important issue to remember is that not everyone‚Äôs plasma can be given, you also have to test the blood ----whether it is safe and also has enough antibodies. So, you have to have an antibody testing mechanism which is being done by NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune, to show that the plasma you are giving has enough antibodies"" Guleria said.

Research should be done on a multi-pronged treatment strategy and should not be focused on only one strategy, the AIIMS Director said.

""You will need to give it to a large number of individuals, more than 200 or 300 people and then analyse the data...We should go ahead in research mode giving it to more people and do a proper well conducted study so as to know one way or the other,"" Guleria said.

Dr Vivek Nangia, Director Pulmonology, MICU and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj, said the therapy is only in the experimental stage, but it is promising as there is a clinical knowledge involved, and also some experiments and past experience behind it having been used for SARS and H1N1 epidemics in a limited manner.

""Dire circumstances require desperate measures, you need to have an out of the box thinking and this is one of those measures, when nothing else is working you want to try this, there is no harm. It has its pros and cons,"" he told PTI.

Backing Guleria, Nangia also said, ""larger randomized placebo-controlled trials are very essential only then we can make it a standard of therapy.""

These expert views come amid lack of definitive evidence in favour of or against the use of the convalescent plasma therapy.

As per reports, a patient who was administered plasma therapy for the first time at a private hospital here was discharged last week after being cured, while the first person to undergo plasma therapy in Maharashtra had died in Mumbai's Lilavati Hospital.

Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said last week that the Delhi government will not stop clinical trials of plasma therapy to treat severally-ill COVID-19 patients as its initial results are good.

Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday said that with the ICMR nod, SMS hospital in Jaipur will start convalescent plasma therapy on COVID-19 patients from Monday, while Maharashtra, which had started the trials last month after a nod from the ICMR, is considering to continue with it despite the Union health ministry warning.

Professor Rajesh Malhotra, Chief Trauma Centre AIIMS, said as of now, there is no concrete evidence of convalescent plasma therapy's usefulness.

""It essentially relies on the assumption that the body fires up its resistance in the form of chemicals called antibodies to fight the infection and those who have recovered have sufficient numbers in their convalescent plasma to fight the infection,"" Malhotra said.

However, the degree of antibody response that a person throws and the timing are variables, making it difficult to have a predictable standard protocol, he said.

It is too early to say if plasma treatment is the only way and it has its own risks also, the AIIMS professor said, adding that at present it is at best an experimental therapy and definitive answers cannot be obtained without large-scale trials.

Dr Pankaj Kumar, Head of Critical Care Unit Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, echoed similar views, saying trials till now are too small to clear doubts about the therapy and large-scale trials should be done.

""Theoretically speaking it should be helpful because we are taking the antibodies from a person who has had the infection. But it is still experimental... we have to weigh the risks and benefits,"" he told PTI.

Dr Atul Kakar, Vice-Chairman, Department of Medicine, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said it is very important to pick the right patient for being the donor as he has to have a very severe infection so that the antibodies are quite high and should be free from other viruses."

The two groups do not regularly partner on projects, but when a defense industry consultant with an engineering background realized weapons makers could help solve supply-chain problems within the U.S. ventilator industry, the creation of Vent Connect was set in motion and is set to be announced on Monday, the people said.

The idea gathered momentum when industry associations like the Aerospace Industries Association, which represents plane makers and defense contractors including Lockheed Martin Corp and General Dynamics Corp, teamed up with AdvaMed, the Advanced Medical Technology Association, whose members include vent manufacturers.

A handful of ventilator makers including ResMed Inc, and Zoll, an Asahi Kasei Corp company, post requests in the ventilator parts marketplace to a group of 60 weapons and airplane makers to help meet surging demand for the life-saving machines, an AdvaMed representative said.

Working since March to cut through challenges as varied as how to handle intellectual property, confidentiality issues, cybersecurity and logistics, the two associations created the marketplace that is now serving as a new avenue for the ventilator supply chain.

The defense companies involved in the project did not want their names published because they did not want to appear to seek credit for their efforts.

At its outset, the task was gargantuan. One ventilator maker, Medtronic, released a parts list with over 1,500 items to see if there was any crossover with the defense supply chain, two of the people said. Alphabet Inc's Google was brought in to help set up a website so that the companies could better coordinate online.

The two industries share some common equipment. For example, fighter jets use pressure sensors to regulate oxygen to their face masks, which are also a key element in a ventilator to ensure that the rhythm of a patient's breathing pattern is monitored and maintained for the person's comfort.

The efforts to try to stem the ventilator shortage are being worked on by the U.S. Army as well. In mid-April, Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy offered an investment of $100,000 to innovators who could come up with a ""rapid ventilator production system to support field hospitals that are still requiring critical infrastructure."""

The event starts at 1300 GMT on Monday but donation figures may not be known immediately. It is unclear how much of the money which will be pledged represents new funding, as financial commitments made earlier this year will also be included.

Saudi Arabia, the current chair of the Group of 20 industrialised countries, has pledged $500 million.

Some EU officials have raised concerns about countries counting in money already pledged earlier this year.

The 7.5 billion euro target is an initial figure. Von der Leyen has said countries will need more money over time.

Britain will hold another online donor summit on June 4."

Liquor buyers who had lined before the shops since dawn used innovative methods like placing their bags and caps in the boxes marked to remain in the queue. Some even offered prayers before the shops and thanked God for hearing their prayers.

As the shops opened, buyers stood in place of their bags and caps.

Since the lockdown, the sale of liquor was banned. It had led to many, who succeded in hoarding stocks prior to lockdown, selling them at a higher price than actual costs.

Illegal sale of liquor too had increased and many were forced to meet their needs by consuming illicit liquor despite it being a threat to health.

Liquor stores in the city and outside opened as per the guidelines and timings fixed by the Excise Department."

The agency's earlier economic forecast was a range, according to which the GDP may either expand by 1 per cent or contract by 1 per cent in 2020-21.

After keeping the country under a 40-day lockdown to arrest the spread of coronavirus, the government extended the lockdown till May 17 with a slew of relaxations to the unaffected areas in order to kick-start economic activity.

""While the graded relaxations announced by the government will permit the resumption of economic activity, the relatively stringent norms in major urban centres will result in the pace of activity remaining constrained,"" the agency said.

It said there is a likelihood of mismatches in labour availability and sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, trade, hotels and transport, will drag down growth.

""Accordingly, we now expect the Indian GDP (gross domestic product) to contract by 16-20 per cent in Q1FY21 (first quarter of 2020-21), which implies that a full-year contraction of 1-2 per cent is inevitable,"" it said.

A slew of watchers have been forecasting for a heavy impact on the already sagging growth -- India was supposed to grow at a decadal low in 2019-20 as per official estimates -- because of the COVID-19 pandemic that has chilled all activity.

The government has already announced a Rs 1.7-lakh crore package to fight the COVID-19 crisis, which many feel is not sufficient. Some analysts have also said that over half of the stimulus package was already included in Budget 2020-21 announcements and is not fresh money. Even as many watchers point to the limited financial space available, there are reports that the government is working on a new package.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut the key policy rate (repo) by a steep 0.75 per cent and also taken a slew of unusual measures to make liquidity available for the needy sectors of the economy with a view to push growth. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das has also said that meeting the 3.5 per cent fiscal deficit target will be challenging and the government may miss the budgeted target."

The announcement was made on Sunday by Dan O‚ÄôDay, CEO of Gilead Sciences, the pharmaceutical company making the vaccine.

The US is the worst-affected country in the world with over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 67,000 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University data.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave emergency use authorisation (EUA) for the use of investigational Remdesivir to treat COVID-19 patients after some researches, including one led by Indian-American physician Aruna Subramanian, found that the drug helped recover some of the infected cases faster.

The EUA allows for Remdesivir to be distributed in the US and administered intravenously by health care providers, as appropriate, to treat suspected or laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in adults and children hospitalised with severe condition.

‚ÄúWe intend to get that to patients in the early part of this next week,‚Äù O‚ÄôDay said on CBS‚Äô ‚ÄúFace of the Nation.‚Äù

He said that his company has donated its entire available supply of Remdesivir, approximately 1.5 million vials, to the government, which can treat anywhere from 100,000 to 200,000 people.

O'Day said the government ‚Äúwill determine which cities are most vulnerable and where the patients need this medicine.‚Äù

Earlier, US President Donald Trump said that his administration has been working with the teams at the FDA, National Institute of Health and Gilead for spearheading this public-private partnership to make this happen very quickly.

In a statement, Gilead had earlier said that the EUA will facilitate broader use of Remdesivir to treat hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, enabling access to the vaccine at additional hospitals across the country.

Remdesivir is authorised for the treatment of hospitalised patients with severe COVID-19 disease, it said, adding that the optimal duration of treatment is still being studied in ongoing clinical trials.

Under the EUA, both five-day and 10-day treatment durations are suggested, based on the severity of disease. The authorisation is temporary and does not take the place of the formal new drug application submission, review and approval process, Gilead noted."

CHENNAI: In the wake of the continuous explosion of COVID-19 cases in Chennai, hospitals here have begun shifting asymptomatic and stable patients to the corporation‚Äôs institutional quarantine facilities.

Dr Narayana Babu, Director of Medical Education, who is in charge of bed facilities, said 73 stable COVID-19 patients from the Stanley Medical College Hospital were shifted to a quarantine facility in DG Vaishnav College on Sunday.

‚ÄúThere are 1750 beds for COVID patients in Chennai government hospitals. Close to 1200 beds have become full,‚Äô‚Äô says Dr Babu, who is also the Dean of Omandurar Medical College.

He said that 270 beds are occupied in the Omandurar hospital out of the 500 beds available while 190 are occupied in Stanley out of the 400 available beds. ‚ÄúWe would only be shifting asymptomatic patients who are below 55 years of age with no comorbid conditions after doing a detailed study,‚Äô‚Äô said Dr Babu.

He added that close to 60 percent of stable patients from Omandurar may be shifted soon to institutional quarantine facilities.

The sudden influx of cases from Royapuram and Thiru-vi-ka Nagar has increased the number of patients in Stanley and RGGGH. ‚ÄúThere are 366 stable patients in RGGGH and we would look at shifting 100 to 150 of them in the first phase by today,‚Äô‚Äô says Dr R Jayanthi, dean of the hospital.

The Chennai Corporation currently has a capacity of 4,000 beds across the city, including 600 in the Trade Center, 120 in Vepery Veterinary College, 42 in Bharathi Women‚Äôs Arts College and some more beds in Loyola College and DG Vaishnav.

Dean of Kilpauk Medical College Dr P Vasanthamani said the hospital has 320 patients at the moment and 40 could soon be discharged.

‚ÄúShifting is not just putting a patient elsewhere. It means moving the hospital itself to another place. So we have to ensure all the medical equipment, thermometers, PPEes are transferred,‚Äô‚Äô says Dr Vasanthamani.

She said patients would only be transferred to institutional quarantine after they are consulted. ‚ÄúWe will ask them if they have any problems being transferred. 25-30 people may be transferred in the first phase once the Corporation gives us details of available quarantine facilities,‚Äô‚Äô she said

Meanwhile, the Special Nodal Officer for Chennai Corporation to tackle the COVID-19 crisis, Dr J Radhakrishnan, said people will get a non-hospital feel in the care centres. ‚ÄúMany patients ask why they are being kept in hospitals when they have no symptoms. These people will get a non-hospital feel in the care centres.‚Äô‚Äô

Dr Radhakrishnan said officials are ensuring that care centres are ready with equipment and food supply. He added that more facilities would come up soon."
