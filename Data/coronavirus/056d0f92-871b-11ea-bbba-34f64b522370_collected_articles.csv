A month into the nationwide lockdown enforced to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Ministry of Home Affairs Friday allowed opening of shops in market complexes outside municipality areas with 50 per cent workers and mandatory precautions like wearing of masks and social distancing norms.

In his monthly Mann ki Baat address on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to speak on the measures the country has taken against the novel coronavirus. On Monday, he is also scheduled to have a virtual interaction with chief ministers to discuss how states are dealing with the lockdown situation and their efforts in flattening the curve of fresh coronavirus cases.

The Ramzan moon was sighted Friday evening and Muslims in India will begin fasting from Saturday as they welcomed the holy month amid unprecedented circumstances due to the coronavirus pandemic and a nationwide lockdown.

Ramzan is usually a festive season, with the daylong fast followed by lavish meals and evening get-togethers. But this year many are confined to their homes, travel is heavily restricted and public venues like parks, malls and even mosques are shuttered.

Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said that stage three (community) transmission has been avoided so far.

Dr Sujit Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control, said that currently 9.45 lakh people in India are under community surveillance for suspected contact with positive cases. “Our weekly doubling time (of cases) has increased from 4.2 on April 6 to 8.6 on April 20,” he said.

And, in a video conference with state health ministers and officials, Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said that stage three (community) transmission, when the source of infection is not easily traceable, has been avoided so far.

In a statement, meanwhile, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) said that apart from the new Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs), the one that is already monitoring Mumbai and Pune will also cover Thane.

In another news, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath Friday directed officials to draw up a plan for the return of UP’s migrant workers in a phased manner from other states where they have completed 14 days of quarantine.

Uttar Pradesh Chief Secretary R K Tiwari told The Indian Express: “Chief Minister has directed today that a plan be prepared. No estimated number (of such migrant workers) is available at present, but it could be lakhs. That is why a plan has to be prepared to bring back such people in a phased manner. Ultimately, these people will have to reach their destination.”

Don't inject disinfectant: Blunt pushback on Trump musing

Business tycoon Anand Mahindra shared a video of an e-rickshaw was modified to isolate passengers during Covid-19 pandemic, and suggested his company’s automobile division should consider hiring the person who did it.

Mahindra, who frequently shares innovations spotted on social media, was impressed by how plastic and metal sheets had been used to create separated seating for all four passengers. Given the restrictions on public transport, the modified e-rickshaw allowed people to remain separated from other passengers.

In the undated video, a man is heard explaining the idea in Bengali and called it a “corona innovation”. The video shows how the driver is separated from passengers by a metal sheet."

Uttar Pradesh government has started bringing back stranded labourers with 2,224 returning from Haryana in the first phase of the initiative, PTI quoted a senior official as saying on Saturday. Briefing reporters, Additional Chief Secretary (Home and Information) Awanish Awasthi said the first batch of workers was brought back in 82 buses from Haryana on Saturday, and 11,000 workers will return by Sunday.

Orders have been issued to prepare shelter homes in the state in a major way so that the returnees can be quarantined there. “Instructions have been issued to install public address system at the shelter homes, and make arrangements for food and toilets,” Awasthi said.

With the lockdown officially delaying the 2020-21 academic year, a government-appointed committee has recommended that the traditional mid-July start for higher education should be pushed to September. Besides this, the panel has also recommended that the year-end or semester-end examinations that could not be held on schedule should be held in July.

The seven-member committee, which was set up by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to deliberate on issues related to examination and the academic calendar in the wake of the classroom shutdown, submitted its report Friday. The UGC will frame guidelines on university examinations, and the academic calendar based on the committee’s report. “The guidelines will not be binding on higher education institutions, but they will lay down the outer time limit by which the government expects them to start their new academic year,” said a source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Three days after its flip-flop over Amarnath Yatra this year, the UT government Saturday said the yatra’s conduct depends on the Covid-19 pandemic situation.

According to an official release, Lt Governor G C Murmu, while interacting with the members of a delegation of Baba Amarnath and Buda Amarnath Yatri Niyas here, observed that “due to the current COVID-2019 pandemic situation, appropriate decision on organizing the yatras can only be taken after periodic reviews of the situation, as a comprehensive planning and execution is involved in the conduct of the yatras”. “Around 20,000 health care professionals and 30,000 police and para-military personnel are working towards containment of Coronavirus, and their availability is also to be ascertained for the conduct of the yatras,” he added.

He assured that the government will explore all possible means required for the conduct of the yatra. “However, all these developments are subject to review in view of the Covid-19 crisis,” he maintained.

On April 22, Shri Amarnathji Shrine Board led by Lt Governor G C Murmu here on Wednesday held that “as on date, it may not be possible to organise the yatra 2020”. “Due to the current Covid-19 pandemic situation being dynamic, appropriate decision on organizing the yatra can be taken on review of the situation in coming future,” it added.

However, earlier it had in a release said that it will not be possible to hold yatra this year in view of the emerging situation due to Covid-19.

Earlier, members of the delegation made several suggestions like curtailing the duration of the yatra, allowing devotees in specific age group, preference for online yatra registration, commencement of Heli-yatra earlier and delay in on-foot yatra as per the prevailing situation and allowing yatra on only one route through Pahalgam etc.

When the delegation suggested a live telecast of the pooja, Lt Governor said that a discussion has already been held on exploring the possibility of telecasting pooja and darshan of Shivlinga online and through other media for the devotees.

He urged the delegation to stay in touch with the langar organisations as well, and assured the best possible support in facilitating the necessary arrangements, wherever required.

The 41-day Amarnath Yatra is scheduled to begin this year on June 23 and culminate on August 3.

Coronavirus (COVID-19): Though its numbers are still relatively small, Bihar seems to be warming up for a rapid surge in novel Coronavirus cases in the coming days. On Friday, it added 53 new cases, taking its tally to a total of 223. The state had been adding fresh cases mostly in single digits till April 19 but has seen its numbers get doubled in the last four days.

After a record-breaking day on Thursday, the number of new cases from across the country saw a dip on Friday. A total of 1376 new cases were reported on Friday, significantly lower than the 1697 that were discovered the previous day. India now has 24,350 people who have tested positive for the novel Coronavirus at some point of time since the outbreak began. More than 4,800 of them have recovered from the disease and already discharged from the hospital.

State (Top 10) Total Cases New Cases Total Deaths Maharashtra 6817 390 301 Gujarat 2815 191 117 Delhi 2514 138 50 Rajasthan 1971 70 32 Madhya Pradesh 1846 159 92 Tamil Nadu 1755 72 20 Uttar Pradesh 1621 111 24 Telangana 983 13 25 Andhra Pradesh 955 62 29 West Bengal 488 11 18

Maharashtra and Gujarat continued to be the main drivers of the increase in India’s numbers. On Friday, Maharashtra reported 390 new cases, almost half of what it did the previous day. The state now has 6817 cases of infections, of which 957 have recovered. Gujarat, on the other hand, added 191 new cases on Friday, to reach a tally of 2815. The number of deaths in the state also continued to rise steadily. On Friday, the state reported 15 more deaths. The state now has recorded a total of 127 deaths, the highest after Maharashtra, with Ahmedabad alone accounting for 83 of these deaths. Ahmedabad now has more deaths than any other city in India except Mumbai.

Here are the cities with most deaths:

Mumbai 178 Ahmedabad 83 Pune 67 Indore 55 Delhi 50

The total death count was inching towards 750-figure mark on Friday night. Maharashtra alone accounts for more than 300 of them.

Meanwhile, the West Bengal government revealed that so far 57 Coronavirus positive persons had die in the state. But it maintained that the virus was not the cause of death in a majority of these cases. An expert committee formed by the state government, after conducting an audit of all the deaths, has concluded that only 18 of these could be attributed to the virus. “The remaining 39 deaths were due to severe co-morbid conditions which were the immediate cause of death, and COVID-19 was the incidental finding,” the state government said in a statement.

West Bengal was the first state to appoint an expert committee to assess whether the deaths of COVID-19 patients could be attributed to the virus or were caused by other reasons. The idea has been caught up with many other states now, and there is great reluctance to share information about the dead. (Don’t miss from Explained: Why it is important to define deaths)

Mumbai, the city with maximum COVID-19 related deaths, has stopped releasing the list of dead, and decided to conduct an audit of all deaths of Coronavirus-positive patients. Delhi had followed suit, and even Punjab have also decided to set up an audit committee. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana rarely share any information about the dead in their states. Gujarat and Karnataka are the only states that are transparently revealing all information about their dead.

Northern Railways plans to develop hands-free washbasins

The Railways plans to roll out hands-free washbasins at all its stations, field units and hospitals to protect its employees and passengers from coronavirus infection. An order was issued Saturday to develop and carry out trial for similar contactless washbasin system for passenger coaches as well.

In this washbasin, the user has to primarily press a pedal attached to the contactless basin with his feet for water and soap to come out from separate dispensers, without touching any knob with his or her hands.

A Northern Railways workshop has, however, manufactured different models of contactless washbasins with the help of local resources and in-house engineering skills – foot-pedal operated with clutch-wire mechanism, foot-pedal operated with mechanical linkage, electro-mechanically operated system, and a sensor-based automatically operated system.

The timeline for the roll-out of the washbasins will depend on the number of orders being given to the Northern Railways’ workshop which has developed the model, a senior official of the zone said.

Despite hilariously omitting the very important ‘N’ in her cheer for her city, Lindsay Dever received heaps of praise online for her solo marathon attempt.

A nurse in Massachusetts was supposed to take part in her first Boston Marathon. But due to the Covid-19 outbreak, like all public events, the marathon too got postponed.

Determined to not let the pandemic deter her plan, Lindsey Devers set out to run her own marathon and hoped to spell out the inspirational message for her city, ‘Boston Strong’ along the way.

However, after running 26.2 miles through a custom route that would spell out ‘BOSTON STRONG’, Dever realised that she hilariously omitted the very important letter ‘N’ and her cheer for her city now reads “Boston Strog”

Take a look here:

Taking to Instagram, the nurse working at Massachusetts General Hospital shared the post about her experience along with a picture of her marathon trail.

Captioning it ‘Solo Boston Marathon Covid Edition’, Dever said that she noticed the spelling error when it was too late to start over.

Despite the spelling error, Denver found heaps of praise on social media for her attempt. Take a look at some of the comments here:

(Source: Getty Images) In the times of Corona, though, #foodporn has taken a different connotation entirely. (Source: Getty Images)

The infamous Rule #34, one of the older memes of the internet, boldly proclaims, “If it exists, there is Porn of it”. Over more than a decade, this tongue-in-cheek (no pornographic reference intended) adage has borne witness to the fact that the internet has been home to expressions which don’t find place in the mainstream. So creative has been this genre that porn doesn’t just refer to sex any more. Internet Porn (as opposed to Porn on the Internet – go figure) often becomes a way of describing user content that defies regulation and finds creative expressions. Thus, trying to find “porn of it”, while trying different options: Tetris Blocks, Gummi Bears, Hello Kitty, and N95 Masks have all found their often funny, often NSFW bizarre renderings as folks on the web have engaged in creating new fantasies.

One of the hashtags that I have been following online has been #foodporn. No, it is not what you think. Nope, it is not about that. OMG, get that filthy thought out of your head – and stop eyeing that eggplant emoji on your phone. While the correlation between food and sex has been long exploited by many texts on eroticism, #foodporn refers to a particular genre of Instagram imagery which stages food as an object of sensual desire rather than nutrition.

As I have written before, #foodporn marks a particular condition of plenty. It reflects an aestheticisation of food – filtered in all its full-frontal glory – that no longer has to worry about the more banal and quotidian anxieties of hunger or nutrition. The restaurant images of appetising food, matched by “home-chefs” recreating masterful dishes have contributed hugely to this genre. However, the obscene moment of #foodporn comes to the fore when you get dishes that are staged only to be photographed, not to be eaten. There has been a growing critique of #foodporn influencers adding colours, additives, plastics, and inedible components so that the food photographs better, only to throw it away, once the image has been captured.

In the times of Corona, though, #foodporn has taken a different connotation entirely. As the privileged lockdown after stockpiling all their shopping carts could hold, our social-media streams have become an obscenity that oscillates between these two extremes. Here is a sample from my feed last week. I have been signed on to groups where people are discussing how they shall use their free time to become masterchefs. In another new group, noobs experiment with ingredients, telling how they braved the pressure cooker, and threw away entire containers of grains and vegetable that they abused in their experiments. In yet another group, intended for simple recipes for our complicated times, there is a constant posting about people displaying the reserves of staples they have in their storage but are stuck because one or two fresh ingredients are missing. In normal times, this would have felt like business as usual – after all, what was the Internet for, if not cute animals and food (and then porn of it)?

However, these acts of normal business feel terrifyingly obscene because every other #foodporn post is punctuated by pictures of migrants walking home – without food, without means, in fear of police violence – fleeing the viral cities in hope of slowing starvation and finding food and shelter. For every perfectly photographed dish, there are reports of millions of people experiencing hunger, malnutrition, and in some cases mortality because of lack of adequate food in the face of this unplanned lockdown. The stories of good Samaritans doing food distribution and communities struggling to take care of its most vulnerable trickle in, but they seem to have no bearings on the deluge of #foodporn that continues to unapologetically, without reflexivity or irony, continue to flood the social timelines. I do not intend to shame people who are, in the comfort of their privileges, filling their time with doing something as basic as cooking and finding joy and solidarity in it. But I have to admit that to me this feels obscene: This capacity to marvel in the spectacles of food, and to emerge heroic when you master a new recipe or find a replacement for an ingredient that has disappeared from the shelf.

We always knew that the Internet was a space of inequality. Even at the best of times, the paradox of those who indulge on the web and those who struggle to bear the burden of its unfolding are stark. But in these times of crises, it perhaps becomes a space of obscenity, where those of us who can, are going to ignore the real world and live in our filtered bubbles, and, well, produce #foodporn. I wonder, darkly, if there is already a porn of migrants walking home, dying of starvation. And I am scared to look for it. Because knowing the depravity of the internet, there is a chance that it exists. Because Rule #34.

As we all practice social distancing in a nationwide lockdown to fight COVID-19, India’s real fighters work tirelessly to keep us safe and protected. Our healthcare professionals battle the pandemic every day at the risk of being most exposed to the virus. India’s security personnel and delivery agents render their services round the clock to keep us safe indoors. The contributions made by media professionals and several other workers amidst the ongoing predicament is also remarkable.

India’s informal sector, on the other hand, is the worst hit by COVID-19 and the subsequent extended lockdown. Thousands of migrant workers who used to send home huge remittances have returned to their respective villages, while others are still locked in cities with no source of income and dried up savings. The daily wagers, street vendors, construction workers, laborers have no means to obtain a square meal for themselves and their families, which also leaves them most vulnerable to the disease.

While we can’t reach out to the needy directly, contributing to their wellness might help the country battle this deadly virus together.

Every Payment Counts

Amazon, the e-commerce marketplace has recently started a donation drive to help India fight COVID-19 together. It has partnered with multiple NGOs like Akhsaya Patra, United Way Mumbai, OXFAM India and Habitat for Humanity who are working on different aspects of the crisis. From supporting healthcare workers to providing for daily wage earners, senior citizens and children, every partner NGO serves India and its people in the best possible ways.

The government recently announced PM CARES Fund (Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund) urging citizens to contribute to India’s war against COVID-19.

On your Amazon India app, you can either choose to donate to PM CARES directly via UPI or to any of the partner NGOs using all payment modes including UPI. When you donate a rupee, Amazon will add Rs. 10 and an additional 10% of your donation. In this time of crisis, every payment counts.

As India intensifies its fight against COVID-19, every payment counts. Your contributions will help procure hygiene kits, grocery kits, and protective gear for health workers and people in need. The shortage of personal protective equipment at times puts the lives of India’s healthcare workers at huge risk. Besides ensuring that our medical personnel has adequate PPE’s, the funds raised through this campaign will also help daily wagers and their families with crucial supplies. Some studies have also proven that senior citizens and children are the most vulnerable to infections, hence sufficient hygiene kits will be provided to keep them safe.

Join the fight against COVID-19, contribute now

Coronavirus has brought our lives to a screeching halt and while many of us still have a steady income, a safe shelter and plenty of supplies, there are scores of unorganized workers who subsist on daily wages and welfare to make a living. Many still don’t have access to basic hygiene products like soaps, sanitisers, disinfectants, and even clean running water. While we are working from the comfort of our homes, our healthcare professionals are working on the frontline to save our lives.

No matter how small the contribution is, it will go a long way in helping our nation battle against COVID-19 together.

Let’s fight coronavirus by helping every Indian stay safe, healthy and equipped

The Vadodara administration on Saturday removed the Tandalja area from the list of red containment zones, easing movement in the area that has been put under cluster quarantine since April 8 after a doctor attached to a trust-run hospital in the locality tested positive for COVID-19.

The area, which has a population of over 7000, was moved to orange zone as no new case was reported from the locality since the quarantine period started.

“The guidelines of the lockdown for the orange zone will still be applicable but it will not be as stringent as those for a red zone area. The decision has been taken in view of the fact that the area did not report a single positive case since it was quarantined. Even the samples collected from the area returned negative. Similar decisions have been taken regarding red zones in cities like Ahmedabad and Surat where curfew was also imposed simultaneously,” Official on Special Duty Vinod Rao said.

He said that while the positive cases in Vadodara have been rising steadily, the recovery of 58 patients is a positive sign.

Meanwhile, the health department has also collected samples of 16 close contacts of the employee of IOCL who tested positive on Friday. The district also conducted more rapid antibody tests on Saturday with a total of 78 samples, all of which have given negative results.

District Health Officer Dr Uday Tilavat said that 15 medical teams have been fanned out to containment areas in Padra, Dabhoi, Karjan and Vadodara, where positive cases have been detected.

“A population of over 9,000 persons will be checked in a door-to-door survey to contain any further spread of the virus,” said Tilavat.

Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that shops will begin to open in Haryana from Sunday onwards.

The Union Home Ministry’s decision to allow opening of shops in residential areas within municipal limits and rural areas failed to find much response in various parts of Haryana. The state government was yet to communicate clear instructions to all the districts, in the absence of which the district administration and shopkeepers were left in a state of confusion Saturday morning.

However, later in the day, Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that shops will begin to open in Haryana from Sunday onwards. Online permissions will be given to open shops in industrial and commercial institutions and rural areas, he added.

“We are waiting for the state government’s instructions. As of now, the previous status exists,” Fatehabad’s Deputy Commissioner Ravi Prakash Gupta told The Indian Express on Saturday.

After the CM’s statement, the government authorised deputy commissioners to take a call on opening of shops (based on MHA’s guidelines) in their respective districts.

At Fatehabad district, most shops including those of clothes, electronic items, barbers and photographers were found shut in the town of Bhuna and villages including Jandali Kalan, Mochiwali and Gorakhpur. At Mochiwali village, an agricultural equipment repair shop was found open.

In urban areas, the MHA has allowed opening of all standalone shops, neighbourhood shops and shops in residential complexes. However, except for already permitted confectionary, chemist and bookshops, no other trade shops were found open in Bhuna town’s market places in residential areas.

The MHA’s fresh instructions allowing shops to open went viral on social media. Shopkeepers in Hisar city thronged marketplaces to open their shops Saturday morning. However, police stopped them from opening their shops since there were no instructions from the state government.

Hisar Deputy Commissioner Priyanka Soni said, “No fresh instructions have been issued from our side as of now because there are no revised orders sent by the state government. Otherwise also, the MHA instructions do not allow opening of shops in the main market complexes of urban areas. The shops located in residential areas in cities are the ones that can be opened. We are waiting for the government’s fresh instructions.”I

In cities of Rohtak and Jhajjar also, the neighbourhood shops remained closed.

In Fatehabad city, even the standalone shops that are already permitted to function remained shut. The district administration has allowed opening of confectionary and a few other shops from 10 am to 5 pm. Earlier these shops were allowed to open in two shifts — 8 am to 11 am and 3 pm to 6 pm — daily. “The revised timings are of no use to us. Villagers come to the vegetable-market early morning to buy vegetables and leave Bhuna town by 9 am. Earlier, when we used to open our shops at 8 am, they used to make purchase from our shops too, but that is not happening now,” said Amit Goyal, a shopkeeper in the market of Bhuna town.

With the number of COVID-19 positive cases increasing steadily in West Bengal, actor and Trinamul Congress MP Mimi Chakraborty has taken to social media to create what she describes as “a positive vibe”, by making public her interaction with COVID-19 survivors. As a first step, she will release a video on Instagram of her interaction with Monami Biswas – the third person to test positive for COVID-19 in the state – on Sunday.

Monami, who was in Scotland pursuing a postgraduate degree, came home to Kolkata a little over a month ago. Having returned to India on March 18, she voluntarily approached the Beleghata Infectious Diseases Hospital to get herself tested on March 19 and tested positive for COVID-19 on March 20, following which she was hospitalised. Upon making a full recovery, she was discharged from hospital on March 31. She says she now wishes to help others suffering from the virus with plasma therapy and personal advice.

Chakraborty, who has regularly been sending financial aid and relief materials to the relatively remote areas of her constituency Jadavpur, says when she learnt about Monami, she wanted to enlist the young survivor’s help in order to heighten public awareness about COVID-19. “I read Monami’s interview on the Internet and was touched by her bravery. I felt her personal experience and advice would make the people of Bengal more aware about the virus, and could help reduce their panic. I’m doing my bit, hope everyone does theirs.”

Incidentally, Bollywood star Kartik Aaryan also took to Instagram recently with his video interviews of COVID-19 survivors.

To ensure that citizens adhere to the lockdown guidelines enforced to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, the Chandigarh police has devised a new technique to tackle non-cooperating suspects.

Cops are now experimenting with a device comprising of a long wooden stick attached to a round-shaped metal to capture violators, which also lets them practice social distancing.

“VIP Security wing of Chandigarh Police has devised this unique way of tackling non-cooperating corona suspects and curfew breakers. Great equipment, great drill,” the DGP Chandigarh police captioned a video he tweeted.

Chandigarh has been declared as a hotspot for the novel coronavirus, and the police have been tasked to maintain the curfew imposed in the city.

Police from other states have too used non-conventional tactics to teach a lesson to people who refuse to pay heed to the prohibitory orders.

In Tamil Nadu, Tiruppur District police caught hold of three youths who came riding on a scooter without wearing helmets or masks. Upon questioning, when the violators were not able to provide an answer to the duty officers, the trio were taken to an ambulance and made to sit with a person who pretended to be corona positive patient.

The youths were terrified and pleaded to get out of the ambulance. They tried several times to escape but in vain. After a while, the police opened the doors of the ambulance and left the violators with a warning. The video of the incident was released by Tiruppur administration and went viral across social media platforms.

Meanwhile, the Kerala police used drones to track those evading lockdown.

Earlier, the Bangalore Traffic Police came up with a skit to spread awareness about the virus and to urge people not to venture out unless necessary.

The video, which was tweeted from their official account, shows a police officer making an announcement before a biker arrives on the scene. A police officer wearing a helmet resembling the coronavirus sits pillion while another dressed similarly runs up and begins troubling the man riding the motorcycle. The rider is then made to wear a coronavirus-shaped helmet, which is meant to signify that he is travelling away with the virus.

The country is under an extended lockdown period till May 3 to contain the spread of COVID-19, a disease spread by the novel coronavirus. So far, over 25,000 people have been infected with the virus.

https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-how-coronavirus-may-affect-the-kidneys-6378915/,"A patient undergoes dialysis treatment at a dialysis centre, amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Guayaquil, Ecuador. (Reuters Photo: Santiago Arcos) A patient undergoes dialysis treatment at a dialysis centre, amidst the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, in Guayaquil, Ecuador. (Reuters Photo: Santiago Arcos)

Apart from ventilators, another kind of machinery that is in shortage amid the coronavirus pandemic is dialysis machines. Different research reports are now suggesting that a significant proportion of Covid-19 patients are experiencing kidney failure or kidney damage.

In the past few weeks, several reports signal that hospitals around the world are looking at shortages of vital equipment other than ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) including dialysis machines in their critical care wards.

Does the virus attack the kidneys?

According to Science, kidney damage is common in severe cases of Covid-19, making death more likely. However, it is not yet clear if the virus directly attacks the kidneys, or if kidney failure or damage is a part of multiple-organ failure. One possible reason that the virus may directly attack the kidneys could be the abundant presence of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the kidneys.

ACE2 is an enzyme found on the outer surface of the kidney. It can be an entry point into cells for some coronaviruses.

One study of 85 hospitalised patients in Wuhan published on the pre-print server medRxiv suggests that over 27 per cent experienced kidney failure. Research in the American Journal of Kidney Diseases (AJKD) says that while initial reports from Wuhan suggested that the burden of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) with Covid-19 was relatively low (3-9 per cent), subsequent analyses demonstrated that the incidence rates of AKI were as high as 15 per cent. Further, AKI is more common among more severe patients who are admitted in intensive case units.

Another analysis published in the journal Nature, however, notes that the prevalence of AKI among patients with Covid-19 seems to be low. In a Chinese cohort of 1,099 patients with the disease, 93.6 per cent were hospitalised, 91.1 per cent had pneumonia, 5.3 per cent were admitted to the ICU, 3.4 per cent had acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and 0.5 per cent had AKI.

Possible ways that the virus may harm the kidneys

Broadly, there could be two possible ways in which SARS-CoV-2 may affect the kidneys, one way is when the body’s inefficient immune system response induces what is known as a “cytokine storm”. In case of a cytokine storm, an overstimulated immune system response can trigger an excessive release of white blood cells, which, instead of repairing damaged tissues, start attacking the healthy tissue as well. A cytokine storm can lead to sepsis, multiple organ failure and potentially death. Therefore, it is possible that a Covid-19 patient may suffer kidney failure or damage as a result of facing multiple-organ failure.

Another possible pathway is when the virus directly attacks the kidneys, possibly because of the abundant presence of ACE2 receptors on the kidney cells.

How are kidney failures and damages dealt with?

As per the AJKD research, in case of kidney damage or injury, some patients may need dialysis, the need for which arises usually in the second week of infection and it affects close to five per cent of the ICU patients. These patterns are consistent with estimates from the SARS and MERS outbreaks.

Therefore, as healthcare systems across the world are stretched out on both material and human resources, it also poses a risk for patients with kidney failure not having access to dialysis care. Dialysis is a process by which unwanted substances and fluids are filtered out from the blood when kidneys themselves are not able to perform this function.

In an art-deco building in the heart of Brussels, Belgium’s leading scientists gather daily to announce the country’s coronavirus toll. It’s been grim reading.

Despite having only 11 million people, the country has reported more deaths from the disease than China. With some 57 fatalities per 100,000 inhabitants, it has the highest per-capita death rate in the world — almost four times that of the US.

According to Belgian officials, the reason for the grisly figures isn’t overwhelmed hospitals — 43% of intensive-care beds were vacant even at the peak of the crisis — but the country’s bureaucratic rigor.

Unlike many other countries, the home of the European Union’s top institutions counts deaths at nursing homes even if there wasn’t a confirmed infection.

Source: ECDC, data as of April 24

“We often get criticism — oh, you’re making Belgium look bad — we think it’s the opposite,” Steven Van Gucht, head of the viral disease division at the Sciensano public-health institute, said while maintaining the requisite distance of 1.5 meters (5 feet). “If you want to compare our numbers with a lot of other countries, you basically have to cut them in half.”

Clearer picture

About 95% of Covid-19 deaths in elderly care homes haven’t been diagnosed, yet Belgium makes the decision to register them based on the symptoms shown and who the people have been in contact with. The goal is to get a clearer picture of the outbreak and better target hot spots.

At the start of each briefing at the Residence Palais, a stone’s throw from the European Commission, Belgian officials detail the day’s statistics in French and Dutch. They draw particular attention to those who die outside of hospitals — typically around half the total.

Also read | Belgium to gradually ease virus lockdown in first half of May

The impact of the disease on vulnerable care-home residents is a growing issue. While Europe knew it would need more ventilators and intensive-care capacity once the virus spread beyond China, the impact on nursing homes was unexpected, according to Agoritsa Baka, a senior expert at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

“It’s a disaster,” she said. “We did not realize how devastating Covid would be if it entered these populations.”

Excess mortality

Yet not all European countries are measuring the impact in the same way, meaning that the numbers of coronavirus deaths are likely thousands higher than the official count of more than 110,000.

The consequence of uneven practices was evident in France. When the country reported data from some nursing homes for the first time in early April, those fatalities were almost double the number of people that died in hospitals.

Last week, Spain had to adjust its historical data after Catalonia started including people who had symptoms but didn’t test positive. This week a local radio broadcaster reported that more than 6,800 elderly died in Spanish nursing homes with symptoms but weren’t recorded in official data.

Germany’s unusually low mortality rate may be helped by the fact that the country only counts deaths that have a positive virus test.

Such discrepancies show up in a concept called “excess mortality,” the number of extra fatalities above typical trends. In Belgium, just over 300 people normally die every day, but this year, it’s jumped to nearly 600.

A project called euroMOMO, originally developed for gauging the scale of flu epidemics, is now being used to track the impact of the coronavirus in Europe.

Good surveillance

Belgium’s practice means that nearly all deaths are accounted for in a given week, while neighboring Netherlands has around 1,000 undefined fatalities. Some countries’ virus deaths are around a sixth of their excess mortality rates.

Better tracking could help improve Europe’s response to outbreaks, especially as the region gradually eases lockdown restrictions, raising the prospect of second-wave outbreaks. Coordinated procedures could also defuse tensions as Europe grapples with recovery efforts.

“We are still in a situation where within the EU we do not count the same way, which could lead to political misunderstandings,” said Pascal Canfin, chair of EU Parliament’s environment and health committee. “It leads to different perception awareness of the crisis.”

In the meantime, the world’s eyes shouldn’t be focused on Belgium because at least the extent of the problem is known, according to Van Gucht.

“When you have a good surveillance system, you report a lot of cases,” he said. “It’s the countries that are not reporting or that are reporting very low numbers, you should be more worried about.”

https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/coronavirus-air-conditioner-temperature-guidelines-humidity-6378739/,"According to ISHRAE, the “best action” to limit risk of infection by air was to ventilate indoor environments with outdoor air. According to ISHRAE, the “best action” to limit risk of infection by air was to ventilate indoor environments with outdoor air.

Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the government has issued an advisory to set air conditioners between 24 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees Celsius and maintain relative humidity between 40 and 70 per cent. The Central Public Works Department (CPWD) issued the advisory to its officials in an office memorandum to address concerns associated with the spread of the disease via air conditioners and ventilation systems.

The guidelines were formulated by the Indian Society of Heating Refrigerating and Air Conditioner Engineers (ISHRAE) taking into considering the climatic regions of the Indian subcontinent. According to ISHRAE, the “best action” to limit the risk of infection by air was to ventilate indoor environments with outdoor air.

Setting temperature and humidity amid Covid-19

The guidelines state: “Set room temperature between 24 degrees Celsius and 30 degrees Celsius. Maintain relative humidity between 40 per cent and 70 per cent. (In humid climates set temperature closer to 24 degrees Celsius for de humidification and in dry climates closer to or at 30 degrees Celsius and use fans to increase air movement).”

It quotes a study that found the transmission of Covid-19 in 100 cities in China lower in high temperature and high humidity. (Don’t miss our explainer: Will summer heat kill coronavirus?)

“Studies conducted at various RH levels have shown that using viral culture methods low temperatures (7–8 degrees Celsius) were optimal for airborne influenza survival, with virus survival decreasing progressively at moderate temperatures (20.5–24 degrees Celsius) and further decreases at higher (greater than 30 degrees Celsius) temperatures,” it stated.

It also quotes a study which has shown that the SARS-CoV-2 can live for 14 days on a surface at 4 degrees Celsius, one day at 37 degrees Celsius and will die in 30 minutes at 56 degrees Celsius.

Humidity, it said, can affect the infectivity — the ease with which infections can take place — of the virus through respiration. In a dry environment, or when there is low humidity, it is easier for foreign particles to invade the body. Therefore, relative humidity of at least 40 per cent is considered the threshold.

“When we breathe dry air the mucous membrane in the lungs become dry. The fluid over lining the cells becomes more viscous, and the little hairs called cilia, which protect our lungs from deep settling of viable and non-viable particles, cannot work and particles settle more deeply in the lungs,” it states. “If we consider oxygen and CO2 transport and the blood, it is only one cell membrane that separates the airspace from the blood. So, if something goes from our lungs into the blood, we get infected.”

It also refers to studies which indicate that relative humidity of 80 per cent and above can neutralise the virus.

Vivek Kohli, a sports goods manufacturer, recently got calls from his doctor friends in Meerut. They weren’t seeking table tennis equipment, which his company Stag International specialises in. Instead, the doctors requested Kohli to manufacture gowns, masks, face shields, and shoes for them.

Days later, Meerut commissioner Anita Meshram reached out to Kohli and other sports goods manufacturers in the city, asking if they could help meet the increasing demand for Personal Protective Equipment for frontline workers battling the coronavirus outbreak. Soon, another producer, VATS Sports began production of PPEs with 40 percent of its workforce to ensure that social distancing norms were followed.

Meerut, where 85 Covid-19 cases were reported as on April 23, is one of the hotspots and has been sealed by the authorities. And doing their bit to help the corona warriors are companies from one of the world’s biggest sports goods manufacturing hubs, who have shifted from making kits or sportswear for athletes to producing PPE for frontline workers during the pandemic.

Kohli, the co-chairman of Stag International – a major manufacturer of table tennis equipment and sponsors of 60 national teams across the world – said they have sent their samples, some made from ‘a type of fabric used for the lining of kit bags’, to the Directorate of Industries in Meerut, which has forwarded them to a central agency for approval.

“We are making gowns, masks, face shields, and shoes as part of the PPE kits,” Kohli said. “Initially, samples of what we made had gone to the Uttar Pradesh medical board for approval and they asked us for some very minor changes. This week, the samples have gone for approval. I am sure it will be approved because top doctors in Meerut have already used it and are wearing it and we have done our tests. Once it is approved, we can supply it in bigger volumes and at a reasonable price because this is a crisis and we need to protect our doctors and frontline workers.”

Stag International are supplying PPE to hospitals and policemen in Meerut. Stag International are supplying PPE to hospitals and policemen in Meerut.

Shortage of PPE, which reduce the chance of frontline workers getting infected, has been reported from around the globe, including India, since the outbreak of the pandemic. “The chronic, global shortage of personal protective equipment is one of the most urgent threats to our collective ability to save lives,” World Health Organisation director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said.

Adapting fast

Apart from doctors, police personnel are also using PPE made in the sports goods manufacturing facility in Meerut. The manufacturing wasn’t without its challenges and manufactures like Stag had to adapt to the need of the hour and experiment fast.

Water-resistant fabric used for making tracksuits didn’t work for PPE. “Initially, I tried with the tracksuit material but water sprayed with pressure was going through. Basically, PPE requirements state that it should not penetrate. So we got another fabric from our supplier, which is now being used for PPE,” Kohli said.

“It is a type of fabric used for the lining of kit bags but the ones used for PPE is thicker, some of it needs to be of 120 GSM (grams per square metre) thickness. India is a hot country and it is summer now so the fabric needs to be breathable. At the same time, it needs to be water-resistant. Some other people made it with plastic, some made it with raincoat material. However, that does not work.”

Kohli added that constant feedback is being taken from doctors about the gowns to ensure quality control.

Another popular brand, VATS Sports, also based in Meerut, has begun production of PPE. They have bagged a contract with the Northern Railways. “For the last one week, we are making gowns. They (Northern Railways) are providing us with the raw material. We have made about 1,500 gowns on machines used to make jerseys and track pants for various sports,” Navneet Vats, partner of the sports goods manufacturer said. “We will only be able to slowly scale up production because we have to take all precautions, maintain a high level of hygiene and ensure everyone is protected while producing PPE.”

VATS, Stag and Sanspareils Greenlands (SG), the company which manufactures cricket balls for Test matches in India, have seen their revenues taking a hit because of the ongoing lockdown. Sports events are still months away and with a similar scenario all over the world, exports have ground to a halt. “This used to be the peak season for us. The IPL is usually held now, academies are open and there are so many summer camps held during this time of the year. There is a lot of demand for all kinds of sports equipment. However, this is a unique situation and we have to do whatever we can to help control the spread of coronavirus,” Vats said.

Reopening of schools and colleges once COVID-19 pandemic is under control is more important for the younger generation than resumption of sport which can take a back-seat for the time being, feels Kapil Dev.

The world has come to a standstill with no immediate signs of resumption of sport of any kind. But sport can wait, feels the 61-year-old former India captain.

“I am looking at the larger picture. Do you think cricket is the only issue we can talk about? I am rather worried about the children who are not being able to go to schools and colleges because that is our young generation,’ Kapil told YouTube channel ‘Sports Tak’.

“So, I want schools to reopen first. Cricket, football will happen eventually,” Kapil said.

The legendary all-rounder reiterated he is not in favour of a bilateral series between arch-rivals India and Pakistan to raise funds to deal with the pandemic as suggested by former Pakistan speedster Shoaib Akhtar.

Kapil said if Pakistan is so desperate to resume bilateral cricket with India then the country first stop anti-India activities at the border and instead spent that money in noble causes.

“You could be emotional and say that yes, India and Pakistan should play matches. Playing matches is not a priority at the moment. If you need the money, then you should stop the activities at the border,” he said.

“The money which will be spent can be used to build hospitals and schools. If we really need money than we have so many religious organizations, they should come forward. It is their responsibility. We offer so much many when we visit the religious shrines, so they should help the government.”

Just like any other industry, football faces before itself an almighty financial hurdle. Instead of witnessing the end of the domestic leagues, FIFA and its stakeholders find themselves manoeuvring through a minefield of problems related to player transfers and contracts this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

In every nook and cranny of the world, football stuttered to a halt by mid-March. With minuscule clarity about the resumption, leagues like Premier League, La Liga, and Bundesliga are feeling the financial squeeze. If football fails to return, a disruption in income from broadcasting rights and gate receipts will hit the funds available for transfer fees and player contracts. But that’s not the only problem.

What and when?

Putting an end to the initial hope of completing the 2019/20 season by June 30, FIFA announced earlier this month that the transfer window will be delayed to accommodate it between the revised end dates for the ongoing season and the start of the 2020/21 campaign. But there’s still a lot shrouded in mystery.

Hypothetically, if the Bundesliga restarts on May 9 as per recent reports and finishes by mid-June, and the Premier League restarts behind closed doors in June and finishes well into July, how will the transfer windows be synced? If a transfer deal takes place between two clubs in Europe, when would a player join a new team? Will the player get to feature in the ongoing season or will there be a wait till the start of 2020/21 season?

As it stands, the Premier League’s transfer window opens on June 10 and runs for 12 weeks until September 1, whereas in other leagues, the window generally runs from July 1 to August 31. Given when the leagues may reopen, the set dates have to be reworked to allow clubs to devise a clear strategy for buying and selling players.

‘Show me the money?’

The window might get rescheduled as per the conveniences of the leagues, but there’s the bigger question about money — how much can the clubs really spend?

Although Premier League clubs went on a spending spree the last four summer windows (over €1.2 billion), the situation isn’t the same this time. With Premier League suspended indefinitely, it reportedly faces a loss of over €860million from failure to satisfy broadcasting contracts. Moreover, the worldwide shutdown has badly hit a barrage of its sponsors, from airlines to betting companies, which is expected to hit the clubs’ commercial revenue.

“In the short term, I would say the transfer market this summer will not exist, it will collapse,” Christian Seifert, the CEO of the German Football League (DFL) told The New York Times. “Some leagues will understand that money is nothing that is coming automatically every month from heaven.”

Seifert’s pessimism is shared by former Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness, who in March said to Germany’s kicker, “The current situation is a threat… transfer fees in excess of €100million will be a thing of the past for the next few years. There will most likely be a new footballing world.”

Going one step further, Damien Comolli, the former director of football of Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur, indicated that an agent had told him only three clubs in the Premier League may have any spending power this summer.

“We might see very little transfer activity. We might see swaps, we might see loans and I think we are going to see a massive decrease in transfer fees,” Comolli told in an interview with Sky Sports. “The longer this crisis goes on, the more clubs are going to be in a financially difficult situation. The first thing that will be impacted will be player remuneration, the second thing will be transfer fees.”

How do they sign?

Instead of preparing for an arms race for talent, the focus of clubs across Europe are on meeting the wage bills of their existing players. In addition to that, there’s a headache about the players whose contracts are set to run out on June 30.

Much to the respite of the clubs though, earlier this month, FIFA swooped in to save the day for players like David Silva, Edinson Cavani, Thiago Silva, Jan Vertonghen, and Zlatan Ibrahimovic whose futures are uncertain. The global footballing body said the contracts would be extended “until such time that the season does actually end.” Their statement also added, “A similar principle applies to contracts due to begin when the new season starts, meaning the entry into force of such contracts is delayed until the next season actually does start.”

But even then, the same dilemma of the dates of different leagues not being in tandem will have a ripple effect in the case of expiring contracts. Will players find themselves unemployed if their league finishes before others? What exactly is in store for Hakim Ziyech (Chelsea from Ajax for €44million) and Francisco Trincao (Barcelona from Braga for €31million) who have pre-contract agreements?

According to CIES Football Observatory, a research group within the Switzerland-based International Centre for Sports Studies, the total transfer value of players from the top-five leagues before the outbreak was €32.7 billion. If the shutdown continues and player contracts are not extended, that value will fall by 28 percent to €23.4 billion due to factors like age, contract duration, and recent form.

If FIFA doesn’t offer more clarity, Italy’s Serie A could be the biggest loser in terms of free agents. An ESPN report estimated the league will lose 26 percent of its players, while La Liga would lose just under a quarter. The Premier League would be the least affected, with a loss of 12.9 percent of its players.

READ | Is the prospect of empty stadiums for football that simple?

Apart from the fall of transfer values of players, there’s the hurdle of settling an existing debt — Premier League clubs owe close to €1.8 billion in outstanding transfer payments based on accounts published at the end of the 2018/19 season. “Many clubs could be threatened by insolvency and transfer plans could come to a standstill for most clubs because of the many uncertainties,” said Matthias Seidel, founder of the website, Transfermarkt, to AFP.

Given the uncertainties revolving around the financial woes of the clubs, FIFA might even have to rip up its rulebook and come up with a new one as the transfer market will be unlike anything ever witnessed before.

(Representational) According to a source, the Indian Veterinary Research Institute has confirmed that the tigress was found negative for COVID-19. (Representational)

The National Zoological Park in Delhi lost its oldest tiger Thursday evening. Kalpana, a 13-year-old white tiger, died around 6 pm. She had fallen sick three days ago.

“The tigress, our oldest cat at the zoo, passed away due to renal failure caused by old age, as per the vets at the zoo and tiger specialist Dr A B Shrivastav and his team,” said zoo director Suneesh Buxy.

As per current protocol across zoos in the country, the animal’s sample was sent for coronavirus testing. “We are just following protocol but there were no symptoms of coronavirus found in the tigress,” said Buxy.

According to a source, the Indian Veterinary Research Institute has confirmed that the tigress was found negative for COVID-19.

Earlier this month, a tiger had tested positive for coronavirus at the Bronx zoo in New York, causing zoos across the world to sit up and take stock of things. At least eight big cats have tested positive since at the Bronx zoo.

Buxy said Kalpana had stopped eating on April 20. A source at the zoo told The Indian Express, “As soon as we realised the tigress wasn’t eating and had become less active, the vet was informed to begin treatment.”

Kalpana was born at the Delhi zoo and had given birth to three tigers over five years ago — two females named Nirbhaya and Seeta and one male called Tipu.

A source said, “ The premises are being sanitised routinely. Sanitisers, masks and gloves have been provided to staff. We are closely monitoring the health and behaviour of all animals at the zoo. ”

Recording more that 100 coronavirus cases for the second consecutive day, Delhi on Friday saw 138 fresh cases and three deaths. The total cases have reached 2,514, with the death toll at 53. As many as 857 people have recovered, with 49 being discharged on Friday.

During the week, the city reported fewer cases as compared to last week. On Monday, 78 new cases were reported followed by 75 and 92 on Tuesday and Wednesday. On Thursday, this shot up to 128.

Of the 2,152 samples sent for testing, 138 samples returned positive Friday, officials said. Among the new cases is a CISF constable posted at IGI Airport. He has been shifted to an isolation ward in Jhajjar in Haryana.

An assistant sub-inspector, posted at Jama Masjid in Central district, has also tested positive. “He was tested for the virus on Thursday, and today we received his reports, which showed he was positive. He has been shifted to a hospital and is undergoing treatment,” said a senior police officer.

“Samples of several other personnel attached with the Jama Masjid police station have also been sent for testing. However, we have not received their reports yet,” said the officer.

So far, at least five police personnel who came in contact with the ASI have been advised to go on home quarantine for 14 days, said police.

Meanwhile, the health department has set up a committee to frame an SOP/security protocol to address safety issues of healthcare workers.

An order has also been issued to Delhi government hospitals to depute at least two trained nursing orderlies round the clock per hearse van to the allocated district, for managing bodies of victims in accordance with the guidelines.

According to health officials, an order has also been issued to refer all COVID-19 patients in need of dialysis to Lok Nayak Hospital. This comes after three private hospitals — Moolchand, Shanti Mukund and National Heart Institute — saw cases where patients who came for dialysis later tested positive for COVID-19.

Meanwhile, the health department has also written to the National Centre for Disease Control to carry out a quick assessment and audit of implementation of various guidelines, SOPs and other measures in hospitals to prevent infection spreading to healthcare workers.

A single judge bench of Justice Nitin W Sambre passed the order on April 23 while hearing public interest pleas filed by Subhash Zanwar and C H Sharma seeking various reliefs and facilities in the wake of the pandemic.

The Nagpur bench of the Bombay High Court has asked the Union government to expedite accreditation of Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) centres of private medical colleges and set up a dedicated portal for granting approvals to facilitate COVID-19 testing facilities at these centres.

The HC also asked the authorities to expedite the setting up of labs in the remote districts of Gondia, Yavatmal, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli after the government submitted that the facilities would be functional only by May 20.

A single judge bench of Justice Nitin W Sambre passed the order on April 23 while hearing public interest pleas filed by Subhash Zanwar and C H Sharma seeking various reliefs and facilities in the wake of the pandemic. The court said, “It is expected that testing facilities can be made operational at private medical colleges, which are armed with proper academic staff, provided such staff is given training of testing and if contingency arises, samples even can be allocated to these private colleges.”

The court made suggestions after amicus curie advocate Anup J Gilda pressed for the need to initiate VRDL facilities on a large scale. Gilda said the only difficulty in making them operational at private medical colleges was non-grant of accreditation by National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) due to its stringent norms.

It is expected that the Centre will step in expedite approval process and may consider setting up of a devoted portal for that purpose, the court said. Assistant Solicitor General (ASG) A U Aurangabadkar submitted that if such pendency of proposal is brought to notice, appropriate steps will be taken to expedite it.

The HC on March 23 had asked the state to take necessary steps for the creation of laboratories for COVID-19 testing within two weeks at Yavatmal, Gadchiroli, Gondia and Chandrapur districts. On April 20, the court had asked the ICMR and the state to clarify when the procedure of establishing labs at hospitals in remote districts would be completed.

On Thursday, the authorities submitted that labs can be made operational at Yavatmal and Chandrapur only by May 20 due to want of infrastructure. The court was told that equipment would be made available by Haffkine Institute, which procured the same from Singapore, but that the shipment was taking time.

The court then directed the health authorities to take appropriate steps for expeditious delivery of Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Machines (RT-PCR) required at VRDL facilities in remote districts.

Hitting the city streets for the fourth consecutive day, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Friday reviewed the lockdown situation at two south Kolkata localities and urged residents to stay at home.

She also said that it was heartening that more than 100 people have recovered from COVID-19 in Bengal. Banerjee, during the recce in her white SUV, asked everyone to offer prayers and perform religious rituals at home, until the viral disease is contained.

Earlier in the day, she had greeted people on the start of holy month of Ramadan, and urged everyone to maintain peace and communal harmony. “Let the home be mandir, gurdwara, masjid and church for all of us till we win the fight against corona,” the CM said through loudhailers from inside her SUV, as residents of Jadavpur 8-B bus stand area and Prince Anwar Shah Road gathered at windows, balconies and terraces on hearing the familiar voice.

Lamenting that Bengalis could not usher in the ‘Nabobarsha’ (New Year) on April 14 with traditional fervour owing to the shutdown, she said that the situation so demanded that people celebrate the day from the safety of their homes. The CM urged everyone to maintain hygiene and abide by the lockdown norms.

Continuing his criticism of Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar Friday accused the state government of failing to combat the Covid-19 outbreak in the state. In a 14-page letter, Dhankhar said that CM Banerjee has adopted a “street fighter approach” and entered into an “accusatory mode” to cover up “monumental failures in these challenging times by series of blunders”.

Dhakhar’s latest letter to the CM came a day after he sent a five-page missive in which he accused her of violating the Constitution. CM Banerjee had earlier reminded the Governor of his “nominated” post and accused him of “consistent interference” in the administration.

In the latest letter, the Governor wrote, “Your communication is part of ‘alibi strategy’ emanates from a script that seeks to cover up monumental failures in these challenging times by series of blunders while people of the state are suffering untold miseries, media is muzzled, health warriors are stressed and there is virtual suspension of human rights of those not belonging to your party. Emasculation of the administration and police has reached pinnacle as a consequence of their politicization. As an escape route, you thought of being in your favourite pastime of being in accusatory mode and take to streets. Let me indicate in times of such gigantic crisis ‘street fighter approach’ is counter-productive and has potential to spell disaster for the people.”

“Please ask those who may pick courage to show the mirror- how sagacious is it for CM to take mike and broom day after day in this grim situation. Real time action and effective governance are need of the hour -not theatrics or politicking. Your unconstitutional confrontationist mode against the Governor as also the Central Government is indicative of ‘Law unto Oneself’ or ‘Stand Alone’ approach. Surely this is antithetical to democracy and you practice it,” the Governor continued.

Dhankhar also said that CM Banerjee cannot run the state of West Bengal like a “fiefdom”.

“Your strategy to be in accusatory mode be it Governor or Central Government emanates from your failure to handle diligently Covid 19 crisis and other burning issues before the people who are in deep distress. Recent violent incident at Baduria in District North 24 Parganas over food supply is only a tip of the iceberg of the looming problem. I know the mismanagement of Covid­-19 combat is virtually in incremental mode given your unfortunate stance to be ‘law unto oneself’ and to be in a bravado mode of collision. State cannot be run like a ‘fiefdom’. It has to be in accordance with the Constitution, for which you have scant regard,” wrote the Governor.

(Representational Photo) The youngest to die this week was a 16-year-old, from Dani Limda area, a hotspot in Ahmedabad. (Representational Photo)

A 17-year-old with no co-morbidities died in Ahmedabad on Friday, the latest casualty in the state of coronavirus who fell neither in the category of high-risk nor had added complications.

So far, eight of the 112 who have died in the state (or 7%) have neither been high-risk nor had any co-morbidity. Ten (9%) have been high-risk but with no co-morbidity, as per a vulnerability profile analysis by the Gujarat Health Department of the dead in the state until Thursday.

High-risk patients are defined as those above 60 years or below five years of age, and pregnant women.

While more than 50% of last week’s deaths in the state were of patients categorised as high-risk along with multiple co-morbidities, this week, a larger number of fatalities involve high-risk patients without any co-morbidity or high-risk patients with a single co-morbidity. Of the total deaths, 43 (38%) so far have been of patients with a single co-morbid condition, while 51 or nearly 45% of those with multiple co-morbidities.

Ahmedabad Municipal Commissioner Vijay Nehra warned on Friday that the city alone was looking at 8 lakh cases by May 31 if its doubling rate of coronavirus cases remains at the existing four days, hitting the 50,000 mark by May 15.

The youngest to die this week was a 16-year-old, from Dani Limda area, a hotspot in Ahmedabad.

According to Dr Jaiprakash V Modi, in-charge superintendent of the Civil Hospital where the girl was admitted, she had the autoimmune lupus disease and was brought to the hospital gasping for breath. “She was on steroids and several other medications and had to be intubated,” Dr Modi told The Indian Express.

Officials at AMC remained unavailable for comment on the case of the 17-year old, despite repeated attempts.

In an analysis of deaths across the state released on April 20, Principal Health Secretary Jayanti Ravi had said more than half the deaths till then (35 of 67) were of high-risk patients with multiple co-morbidities.

Ravi said, “We found that 35 of the deaths or 52.23% were patients categorised as high-risk and had multiple co-morbidities, 21 deaths that is 31.34% were high-risk patients with a single co-morbid condition, four deaths were of high-risk patients with no co-morbidity and seven deaths were seen in patients neither categorised as high-risk nor had any co-morbidity.”

Since then, based on the data provided by the state government, every day has seen some deaths with no known co-morbidities. On April 21, for example, the dead included eight patients with no known co-morbidities. The next day, five more with no known co-morbid conditions died, while Thursday saw a 60-year-old man with no known co-morbidity succumb.

In an online press briefing, Nehra said they were confident that by the time this phase of the lockdown ends on May 3, Ahmedabad would have increased its doubling rate to seven-eight days. This would lower case projections to 10,000 by May 15 and 50,000 by May 31 for the city.

“On April 17, Ahmedabad had 600 cases, which doubled to more than 1,200 on April 20, that is within three days. At present, the case doubling rate is four days, and if this remains, the city will have 50,000 cases by May 15 and 8 lakh cases on May 31,” the Municipal Commissioner said.

On Friday, Ahmedabad reported 151 new cases and seven deaths, taking the total number of cases to 1,638. Out of these, 105 have been discharged while 74 have died. Out of the 1,459 active cases, 1,440 are stable and 19 on ventilator.

Gujarat had a doubling rate earlier of nearly four days, shooting up from 1,108 cases on April 17 to 2,216 on April 21, but this is now believed to be around six days. On Friday, the count stood at 2,815.

The state’s average tests per million population figure stands at 593.66, less than half compared to Delhi and lower than other badly hit states.

On March 17 and 18, when a group of 10 Indonesians visiting Karimnagar in Telangana tested positive for COVID-19, they were the first cases in the state, setting off a nationwide Tablighi Jamaat scare as they were traced back to the gathering in Delhi.

Less than a month later, Karimnagar is set to become the first district in Telangana to be free of coronavirus, with the last two of its 19 positive cases ready for discharge. The district has seen no deaths attributed to coronavirus.

From seven containment zones on April 5, Karimnagar town is down to just one, with restrictions lifted in the other six. Health officials said surveys showed no new cases outside the seven zones in the district.

District Medical and Health Officer Dr G Sujatha attributed the success to aggressive and extraordinary measures taken to contain the spread. “Even before the national lockdown was announced, we had sealed Karimnagar town, especially the affected zones. We also tracked 770 foreign returnees and after checking them, put them in home quarantine.”

Sujatha said District Collector K Shashanka formed teams and ordered door-to-door surveys to identify people who may have come in contact with the Indonesians. “Over 100 teams, each comprising a doctor, supervisor, ANM and ASHA workers, reached out to every family in areas the Indonesians had visited. The survey of every family member was done daily morning and evening.”

The Karimnagar cases had set off alarm bells as so many in one group, as well as their Indian guide, had tested positive — an epidemiological red flag.

Officials said at least 400 people from Telangana had participated in the Tablighi Jamaat meeting, at least 17 of them from Karimnagar. They returned between March 13 and March 18, with five of them accompanying the Indonesians.

The foreigners’ group was first noticed by police and a health worker, who reported it to authorities. The first Indonesian tested positive on March 17, the remaining nine the next day, after which they were moved to Gandhi Hospital in Hyderabad. The group was found to have travelled from Delhi in a second-class coach of AP Sampark Kranti Express, got down on March 13 at Ramagundam in Peddapalli district, visited several mosques, travelled in a six-seater autorickshaw, and participated in at least four meetings before arriving in Karimnagar on March 14. In Karimnagar, they had again visited several mosques, as well as an institute where they interacted with students.

That meant tracing as many people as possible who had come in contact with them, including those on the train and the auto driver.

The district administration put special focus on senior citizens and those with co-morbidities in its surveys. “We reached out to people of 60 years and above and those with diabetes, hypertension, asthma and other ailments. As these people are highly vulnerable to the infection, we checked on them daily. A call centre was started to track their health,” Dr Sujatha said, adding that the helpline set up by the District Collector had also received queries from Saudi Arabia on the virus and its symptoms.

All private hospitals, government primary health centres and private doctors were told to report if any patient had fever, flu or other symptoms similar to coronavirus. The Indian Medical Association was roped in to conduct rapid fever surveys in particular areas.

In all, 480 samples were tested in the containment zones. The 19 cases that tested positive were admitted to District Hospital, of whom 17 have been treated and discharged. Shashanka said that while the door-to-door surveys continue, “Since three weeks no new cases have been reported.” As of April 24, 164 remain in home quarantine, all of whom are doing well. A medical team continues to visit them daily, morning and evening.

The two remaining active cases have recovered, as well as completed a 14-day quarantine. As the state has now extended quarantine to 28 days, they are waiting this to get over for discharge.

Among those already discharged are the Indonesians, who continue to be in Karimnagar, waiting for the lockdown to end to go home.

The Karnataka government has ordered a probe into the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak among employees of the Jubilant pharma company in Nanjangud, Mysuru.

Karnataka Chief Secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar in order on Friday has asked IAS officer Harsh Gupta, who is the nodal officer for the Covid-19 containment in the Mysuru district to inquire into and submit the report in a week’s time.

“Despite stringent measures by the state government, there are many COVID-19 cases reported in Mysuru district. The main reason for the district to emerge as a COVID-19 hotspot is a Jubilant factory in Nanjangud” states order by Vijay Bhaskar.

“Within one week the report should be submitted by Harsh Gupta by conducting inquire into how, from whom and where the infection first spread in Nanjangud, what are the reasons for the infection spread, what is the responsibility of the company, and others in the spread,” the order said.

The source of the infection of the first person who tested positive for the virus in the Mysuru pharma firm cluster on March 26 has been a mystery. The first case of the firm was a 35-year-old employee in the quality assurance department.

The cluster has gradually spread to more employees, their family members, close contacts, and others over the last one month. Out of the total 89 COVID-19 cases reported in Mysuru district till Saturday, 74 are linked to the Jubilant Pharma company in Nanjangud. The samples of 780 of the over 1000 employees at the firm in Mysuru have been tested for COVID-19, according to health department officials.

Initially, a consignment from China that landed in the factory was suspected to be the source of the infection. The health department had sent the swab samples from the packaging material collected from the pharmaceutical company to the National Institute of Virology (NIV) Pune for tests but the report came negative.

There has been some speculation that P52, the first patient in the Jubilant Generics cluster at Mysuru, traveled to China in the period before he tested positive but this has been denied by the firm in an official statement issued earlier.

“Patient P52 did not travel to China or on any overseas trip in the last six months. Further, none of the employees tested positive so far travelled overseas in the last six months,” said the pharma firm Jubilant Life Sciences Ltd which owns the Jubilant Generics subsidiary.

“Jubilant Generics Limited at its plant located at Nanjangud, Mysore manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients used in drugs that are needed for sustaining patients lives, including Azithromycin Dihydrate and Azithromycin Monohydrate, which are needed to fight the global menace of COVID-19,” the firm said.

“Patient P52, the first positive case of COVID-19 from the Nanjangud facility, never had contact with any raw material nor a role in receiving, transporting, handling or storage of raw materials,” the firm said while referring to the Covid 19 negative report from NIV, Pune with respect to material and containers shipped to the firm from China ahead of the outbreak.

Covid-19 death: Protests against cremation in Dakshina Kannada

The death of a 75-year-old female patient from Bantwal in Dakshina Kannada was confirmed late evening on Thursday by the Health Department. “Identified as P 432, the patient who tested positive for COVID-19 had a history of hypertension, stroke and pneumonia died at Wenlock District Hospital,” Karnataka’s Covid-19 spokesperson and Education Minister S Suresh Kumar had confirmed.

Following this, the body was taken to Bantwal, and then to Kaikunje where cremation was completed by 3 am on Friday, according to Bantwal MLA Rajesh Naik.

Requesting citizens to refrain from such “inhuman protests” in the future, Suresh Kumar said, “No family should become untouchable because of this infection. Citizens should avoid objecting cremation of the deceased. I think we should educate our people. I also request people to refrain from such inhuman activities, even if it might be due to lack of awareness and knowledge in the issue.”

(Source: HIPAMSIndia/ Facebook) The handpainted artwork and the song on the Covid-19 pandemic took around 15 days for the artist to complete. (Source: HIPAMSIndia/ Facebook)

Amid the gloom of the pandemic and the frustrations of isolation, the role of art and artistes have become more central to people’s lives, whether they realise it or not. From creating awareness to making political statements, Covid-19 has become a subject of topical and attention-grabbing art across the globe. From beautiful murals dedicated to health professionals to opera performances via video conferencing — art has been used as a poignant tool to convey important messages. A recent entry to that list, a Patachitra on the pandemic by veteran artist Swarna Chitrakar from Paschim Medinipur in West Bengal, is going viral.

Patachitra is a unique folk tradition — a perfect amalgamation of aural and visual storytelling. For generations, Patachitra artists known as ‘Patuas’ have been painting and composing songs on social issues to easily pass on meaningful information.

Bengal Patachitra is known for its long scrolls depicting a story, where several frames are painted to narrate different parts of the tale with vivid imageries, explained through a catchy tune. Chitrakar, in her early 50s, has painted a detailed narrative with figures donning not just masks but even PPE suits to capture the mayhem and sadness caused by the virus outbreak. A big monster in red depicts the virus.

The word ‘Pata’ comes from the Sanskrit word ‘Patta’, meaning cloth, while ‘Chitra’ refers to painting. In Patachitra, stories are painted as frames vertically, and the Patuas gradually unfurl them while presenting the story through their songs. The songs are known as ‘Pater Gaan’.

For her recent work, the artist painted an elaborate seven-frame scroll and composed a song with all relevant information. From highlighting how the virus may have originated in China but the sufferings are felt throughout the globe, through her recent artwork, the award-winning artist talks about a ‘universal pain’. And that’s not all. In her vibrant and informative artwork, she talks about different precautionary measures along with the selfless work and sacrifices by medical professionals.

(L) Doctors painted to depict wearing PPE suits while treating patients; (R) people shown washing hands. (L) Doctors painted to depict wearing PPE suits while treating patients; (R) people shown washing hands.

“It took me about 15 days to write the lyrics, compose the song and paint the scroll,” Chitrakar told from her village, Pingla. She got help from her husband, who prepared all the colours and natural dyes, extracted from flowers and plants. Pingla is famous for its Patachitra and Pater Gaan — unique cultural traditions of Bengal and is home to more than 250 Patachitra artists.

Although Patuas mostly paint and sing on various themes like mythological tales, contemporary and social issues too have evolved in recent times.

The artist said the scale of the pandemic made it hard to ignore. “Every conversation in the world is currently dominated by this infectious disease, and seeing everyone go through the same pain, I thought I too must do something to capture that as well as use it to raise awareness,” she said over the telephone.

The Covid-19 virus painted in red on the scroll, while humans have been painted wearing masks in her latest creation. The Covid-19 virus painted in red on the scroll, while humans have been painted wearing masks in her latest creation.

“In the past, I have painted and composed songs on other diseases like Tuberculosis, HIV-Aids among others issues. So, I used my prior knowledge to make this new artwork,” she added.

Her over 7-minute long song not only talks about the problems but also solutions and measures taken. From highlighting how lockdown helped to flatten the curve to different initiatives taken by state and central government, her latest Patachitra covers it all.

“I know, lockdown is essential, but so many people have been left without jobs and are being pushed into poverty. So, I thought it was important to highlight why no one should die in hunger while already being scared of the disease,” added the artist who has travelled the world.

The mother-of-five daughters, all Patuas, shared what a relief it was that she hadn’t travelled recently. “My daughters keep telling me, it’s good I wasn’t abroad, or I wouldn’t have been allowed to enter the country, forget the village. They say, they would have just cried and without seeing me,” she said. Chitrakar who is revered around the world for creating a unique style of her own — merging the styles of both Kalighat Patachitra and Medinipur Patachitra, has conducted workshops and exhibited her works at various prestigious institutions.

“I was supposed to travel to the US, my daughters were scheduled to go to Australia but all plans have been cancelled now. I still have some savings and can help my family, but there are many poor artists in our village who are struggling to make ends meet,” she informed.

The artist said some artists in the village have been getting the free ration announced by West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee for the low-income families, but other than that no additional measures have been taken up for them.

“There are some small NGOs and groups that operate here, they have been inquiring about our wellbeing regularly. Today, our Patua para received a donation of essential supplies — from rice to lentils and even soap,” she added.

However, despite all the gloom, she continues to be optimistic. “I just hope we all can defeat this virus. If we are all well and alive, he can perform and earn once again by travelling the world, just like before,” she said.

Heightened vigilance against the communal virus, and a firm resolve to act against it, must be, and must be seen to be, an essential part of India’s anti-COVID strategy.

Amid the coronavirus crisis, three states framed a terrible everyday bigotry —but also, and hearteningly, a swift and lawful state response. In Mumbai this week, a resident of a suburb who refused to take groceries from a Muslim delivery-person was arrested. The delivery person had recorded a video of the bigoted behaviour he was faced with on his phone, Section 295A of the IPC treats as an offence “deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs”. In Gujarat, arrests have been made for circulating messages on social media that cited the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in New Delhi — which did contribute significantly to the making of a COVID hot spot — to call for the social and economic boycott of the entire Muslim community. In Uttar Pradesh, after it came to light that a private hospital had issued an advertisement saying it would not admit Muslim patients unless they took a COVID test, the Meerut police filed an FIR against the owner under Sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 295A and 505 (statements “conducing to public mischief”). Such action taken in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh — states that are, incidentally, ruled by the BJP and the Shiv Sena, parties not exactly known for their political commitment to the secular principle —may not deter the next act of hate on the street, but it points to the way forward. At a time when anxieties and fears sparked by a shared health crisis are threatening to drive the wedge deeper between communities and sharpen polarisation, rendering the Muslim community doubly vulnerable, the state needs to, quite simply, uphold the law.

The problem, of course, is that for the most part, the state either looks away from acts of religious prejudice and discrimination that violate the fundamental rights and freedoms of fellow citizens, or becomes complicit in them. Or, responds defensively, as when the charge is levelled by governments and organisations located abroad — as it did, recently, after the OIC spoke of a rising “Islamophobia” in India in times of the coronavirus. The Indian envoy to the UAE, and the Indian embassies in Oman and Qatar rose immediately to douse that controversy, lest it affect the country’s image and ties in a region crucial to India’s diplomacy and strategy. On the other hand, it is inadequately realised or acknowledged how grievously religious polarisation, and the failure to act against it, could hurt, and even roll back, the hard-won gains that India is slowly and laboriously making in its battle against the virus.

In fact, heightened vigilance against the communal virus, and a firm resolve to act against it, must be, and must be seen to be, an essential part of India’s anti-COVID strategy. The state must be on guard against communal bigotry, not just because it can erupt in violence, but also when it takes a costly toll on the many solidarities that shore up the fight against a common enemy in a public health emergency.

There is risk and there is uncertainty. Since the days of Frank Knight, economists have differentiated between the two. Risk has a known probability distribution. For uncertainty, the probability distribution is unknown. COVID-19 makes us confront uncertainty, not risk. In either event, agents maximise expected payoffs. For risk, there is a given probability distribution that can be used by everyone. For uncertainty, there is a subjective probability distribution, which can, and does, vary from individual to individual.

How do I devise this subjective probability distribution? Through information and experience I already possess. There are various rationality assumptions used by economists. They are often violated. Otherwise, behavioural economics wouldn’t have taken off. Typically, given a situation, when your decision doesn’t agree with mine, I say you are irrational. However, with uncertainty, the problem may not be with rationality assumptions, but with differences in subjective probability distributions. Because of COVID-19, there is a certain risk of getting infected. Let’s call this the infection rate — total infections divided by the total population. Do I know what this infection rate is, for India, or for any other country for that matter? I don’t. I am not being pedantic. To the best of my knowledge, no country has done universal testing.

Opinion | India has played an exemplary role in tackling the Covid-19 crisis

No country has done universal testing for a proper random sample either. The ICMR has told us more than 75 per cent of Indian patients will be asymptomatic. Who do we test? Those who show symptoms, those who have been in contact with confirmed patients and those who suffer from severe respiratory diseases. Most countries do something similar. In other words, when I work out an infection rate based on those tested, there is a sampling bias. This isn’t a proper infection rate. To the best of my understanding, the only country where we have had something like a random sample is Iceland. There, the infection rate was 0.8 per cent. There are similar caveats about the death rate. If I mechanically divide number of deaths by the number of confirmed cases for India, I will get a death rate just over 3 per cent. The global figure is a little less than 7 per cent. But neither of these is a death rate for the total population, since only those with severe symptoms are included in infection numbers. Three per cent or seven per cent are over-estimates. In a controlled environment like Diamond Princess, death rate as a ratio of total passengers, and not those infected, was less than 0.4 per cent. The true infection rate and true death rate are not alarming numbers.

What does this have to do with differential subjective probability distributions? There are slices in India’s population pyramid with rural/urban and other spatial differences too. Consider two extreme types. Type A, who are globalised in information access and morbidity. Life expectancy is 80 plus and there are lifestyle diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure. This co-morbidity increases possible death rates and thanks to globalised access to information, certainly increases perceptions about death rates, making them out to be higher than they are. Some of them have fixed incomes, regardless of what happens to lockdown. Therefore, if you think in terms of maximising expected payoffs with a subjective distribution, high probability is attached to loss of life and low probability to loss of livelihood. I have simplified, but you get the general idea. Contrast this with Type B, someone whose life expectancy is 60, without a fixed income stream and whose health concerns are tuberculosis and water-borne diseases, not COVID-19. Nor is access to information that globalised. High subjective probability will be attached to loss of livelihood and low probability to death from COVID. Both the types reflect subjective probabilities. Neither is “irrational”. There is tension between the two. Type A would like the lockdown to continue indefinitely, until long tail of the infection curve tapers off, perhaps beyond September. Type B would like lockdown to be eased soon, with necessary restrictions in hotspots. There is indeed tension between lives and livelihood. Even if health outcomes and information access are like Type A, but income is contingent on growth, preferences might mirror Type B.

Public policy needs to balance such differential individual preferences. This used to be the aggregation issue of the once fashionable, and somewhat esoteric, social/collective choice theory. Doing injustice to that entire literature and reducing it to column-type language, if preferences are heterogeneous, one set of individuals imposes its choice on the rest. Type A disproportionately influences policy. This determination of aggregate preferences is a dynamic process. Therefore, sooner or later, Type B contests this and as the lockdown is prolonged and livelihood costs mount, discontent surfaces, as it has across a range of countries. There were also welfare economics notions that pre-dated social choice theory, such as compensation principles of Kaldor, Hicks and Scitovsky. The point can be made using the two stereotypes. Specifically, Type A need to compensate Type B for their losses. To state it starkly, livelihood losses suffered by Type B need to be compensated by government through redistributive measures and this has to be financed by higher taxes imposed on Type A. The right question for the Type A is not whether they want the lockdown to continue, but whether they are willing to pay a COVID-tax to support lockdown extension.

This is meant to be a caricature, but it illustrates the public policy dilemma. Note that without a revival in growth, tax-paying capacity of Type B is limited and with job losses, some Type As become Type Bs. The choice is starker.

Chinese attempts to displace American economic and strategic hegemony in the international system were not going to be without friction. This competition opened up the prospect of what Graham Allison described as the Thucydides Trap — the possibility of deepening tension as one great power seeks to replace another. This tension has now been immeasurably deepened. The Trump administration has been seeking to redefine the terms of the economic relationship with China. And the COVID-19 crisis has turned the world public opinion against China in ways that were unimaginable a few months ago. China is being widely held responsible for a cover-up and a delay in the global response to the virus. Country after country is rethinking its economic relationship with China.

But when the dynamics of the Thucydides Trap were being analysed, few had imagined that this competition would break out when both the Chinese and the American political systems would be facing deep internal challenges. This opens up the possibility of overlaying what is known as the Tacitus Trap over the Thucydides Trap. The Chinese coined the term, “Tacitus Trap,” in homage to the great Roman historian, Tacitus. This trap describes a condition where a government has lost credibility to the point where it is deemed to be lying, even if it speaks the truth. President Xi Jinping himself used this term as a call to arms to the Chinese government to maintain its credibility. What tactics the Chinese government will adopt to achieve this end is an open question. But even the Chinese coiners of the term could not have imagined that the Tacitus Trap might not just be a challenge facing China. It could become the defining political condition of our time. Authoritarian governments would face a credibility crisis because of their propensity to control information. Many democratic governments face a different credibility crisis: Hyper-partisanship would simply make truth or lies a function of which side was saying it, making sober collective action difficult. The existence of a possible Tacitus Trap exacerbates the risks of the Thucydides Trap.

Opinion | Beijing’s response to Covid underlines that the world needs more democracy, not less

A great power competition is riskier when the political systems of the great powers display greater pathologies than strength. The Chinese and American political systems are by no means equivalent. But their weaknesses seem to be gaining the upper hand. In the US, healthy political competition has been replaced by hyper-partisanship: At the federal level, many of the checks and balances on executive power have been denuded; American federalism which was a shock absorber is now also a potential source of conflict; class conflict is at the deepest it has been for decades. With President Donald Trump there is looming uncertainty over just how much the institutional frame of American politics might get tested. But one surest sign of an internal pathology is when a power gives up the very ideas that gave it deep internal and external legitimacy. America made horrendous mistakes in the conduct of its international affairs. But it was able to absorb the moral costs of those mistakes because of the ideological allure of its model — grounded in openness. The American system has a capacity for renewal. But it will be a long haul.

The Chinese regime will face a deeper legitimacy crisis of its own. A legitimacy crisis does not mean a weakening hold on power. It can have the opposite effect — an aggressive and coercive hunkering down of elites. But the signs of a crisis are apparent: The increasing use of coercion, surveillance and repression and the even more insistent control of information orders. The Chinese government might get high marks for its lockdown strategy. But the stigma that it covered up the facts and inflicted needless damage on China and the world will gnaw at its political system. China’s relatively quiet confidence that it would gain global ascendancy in the world system has been replaced over the last few years by a bellicose diplomatic aggressiveness. This is not a sure-footed regime confident of its capabilities and growing external legitimacy.

This internal disarray in both superpowers heightens external risks. Domestic political compulsions to take a more aggressive external posture towards the world are heightened. There is little doubt now that the “China Question” will now be one central theme of the American election, and partly understandably so. But the China question will, in some senses, displace, the thornier questions over economic and social policies of both parties. It will be the trope through which internal contradictions are papered over. And in that context, the incentive of both parties will be to outbid each other in the hard line they propose.

China is in an even more difficult situation. There is no question that the world will increasingly call China to account for its actions during this crisis. The intention may not necessarily be to censure China. It can be driven by the desire to ensure that there are sufficient levels of transparency and international cooperation to both combat the virus, and to minimise the risks of such events being repeated. But the Chinese regime will not find it easy to accommodate the international community, without in some senses, risking opening up a domestic can of worms. Such openness and transparency would now be inconsistent with the principles by which the regime now secures its internal legitimacy. It will also be hard to do, without a serious loss of face, in the context of the China question now becoming the central axis of American politics. The autonomous dynamic of nationalism in one country can risk reinforcing it in the other.

The challenges of dealing with the pandemic or existing interdependencies may yet impose a degree of sobriety on both superpowers. But the demands on internal legitimation are increasingly pointing in a direction where both countries will not find it easy to dial back from ratcheting up tensions, in ways that might make delicate diplomacy more difficult.

We are at a transformative moment where almost all the rules of the international order are potentially up for renegotiation, from trade to cybersecurity, from the environment to pandemic risks. The massive economic shock of the COVID crisis is going to occasion deep restructuring of the domestic economies. But for these challenges to occur when the political systems of both superpowers are becoming exaggerated caricatures of themselves does not bode well. We might not just be in G-Zero world, with the two major powers abdicating their international responsibilities; we might be in G-minus-two world, where the internal credibility crises of the governments of the major powers work simultaneously to the detriment of the international system.

Transcending geographical boundaries — and every socio-economic and political demarcation — the COVID-19 outbreak has caused huge disruptions globally. It has substantially punctured mankind’s vanity.

However, the United Nations secretary-general, António Guterres, was wide off the mark when he termed the pandemic as the greatest test we have faced since World War II. The scourge of nature is far more serious a threat than man-made wars. It is in this context that I see India’s role as exemplary. Among the world leaders, Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to be particularly perspicacious — not only did he ascertain the real nature of the crisis, but he helped to prepare a graded response to it.

A timely response mitigates the effects of a disaster and India has been spot-on in this regard. As Modi pointed out in his message to the nation on April 14, India took “quick and decisive action” and adopted a “holistic and integrated approach” in the absence of which the country’s situation could have been drastically different from what it is now.

India has shown remarkable perceptiveness and alacrity in tackling the pandemic: From conducting screenings at airports to visa restrictions, India has been scaling up its response well ahead of time. India, under the leadership of PM Modi, has moved with a meticulously planned roadmap in its fight against coronavirus.

Finally, there also came the most difficult decision: Shutting down all movement to stop the spread of the coronavirus. This was an extraordinary decision in many ways. From persuading people to stay at home, to planning for the economic impact of such an unprecedented lockdown — and also implementing it humanely and sensitively. The decision could not have been taken without exceptional leadership skills.

In an appreciable display of democratic ethos, PM Modi directly reached out to the 1.3 billion citizens to seek their mandate. They supported the move and the lockdown has now been extended, again, with full popular support. Further, he also spoke with all the state chief ministers who reciprocated in equal measure, highlighting the cooperative nature of Indian federalism.

Acting in tandem with the Union government, Bihar chief minister and Janata Dal (United) president Nitish Kumar displayed his remarkable aptitude for governance and foresight in educating people about the merits of social distancing. Unlike industrialised states, Bihar is a predominantly rural state with pockets that have some of the highest population density in the world. One misstep could have led to havoc. As of now, the state bears the maximum pressure of migrant labourers from across India and is a veritable communal cauldron. Yet, the behaviour of the people of the state is highly disciplined and admirable. That is an obvious reflection of the people’s trust in the leadership of Nitish Kumar.

I would not hesitate to say that Bihar, with its limited resources and other constraints, is indeed an “outlier state” on most parameters of performance in containing the spread of COVID-19. The recovery rate of patients diagnosed positive is arguably better than many others in the world. The community spread has been effectively contained there, so far. In rural Bihar, a sustained campaign to promote cleanliness and social distancing has made people acutely aware of the pathogen’s insidious ways of attacking the human body.

Besides Bihar, other states too have been evolving their response models. We are proud of how the political executive, bureaucracy, medical professionals, health workers, the police and ASHA workers in villages, have combined to do their best in checking the spread of the contagion. The media deserves unreserved appreciation for making people aware of the dangers of the pandemic.

Contrast this with the onslaught of the Spanish flu in 1917-1919 — and the number of deaths then — and you will know the difference. Unlike in the past, India seems to be better placed now and ahead of the curve — not only in evolving a response to the corona menace but to mitigate the plight of its people as compared to Europe, the US, and China. This crisis has foregrounded a unique aspect of PM Modi’s humanist approach. His persuading people to remain in sustained lockdown is guided by his impulse of not making human life subservient to economics.

This strategy has been successful so far. The health ministry has estimated that without the timely imposition of the lockdown, COVID-19 cases could have registered a 41 per cent cumulative increase, reaching up to 8.2 lakh cases, by April 15.

The leadership role that India has assumed in dealing with this crisis is now being appreciated across the globe. India has shown the world that it can not only handle this crisis upfront but also provide aid and support to the marginalised sections of society. The government is making all possible efforts to provide relief to the poor and the migrant workers. A relief package of Rs 1.7 lakh crore, aimed at providing a safety net along with insurance cover for frontline medical personnel, is something that is being acknowledged as a template in the collective fight against the virus.

In the true spirit of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which means “the world is one family”, India has taken the lead in helping the world at this hour of need. India, the largest producer of the drug hydroxychloroquine, has been generously helping many countries with the supplies of this potential cure of COVID-19.

The war against the virus is still raging. But the country has gained great confidence from the exceptional patience of its people, the quick response of public authorities and, above all, from its trust in the leadership. As partial relaxations begin soon, I hope the people embrace more positivity. Amidst all the gloom the world over, this will also not be a small achievement.

Prince William just made his comedy debut with a cameo on BBC’s The Big Night In, with Stephen Fry, to raise funds for coronavirus.

In the show, the Duke of Cambridge appeared as himself in a sketch of the 1980s sitcom Blackladder. Fry appeared in the role of Lord Melchett, the royal household staffer he originally played on the show.

William spoke about the royal family and made jokes about himself during the episode. On Fry suggesting that he should watch Tiger King, William remarked, “I tend to avoid shows about royalty.”

“#TheBigNightIn celebrated the acts of kindness, humour and the spirit of hope and resilience that is keeping the UK going during the COVID-19 Pandemic,” Kensington Palace mentioned on its official Instagram page. Take a look:

While social distancing and a national lockdown have been initiated by the government to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, there are occasional bouts of diseases like malaria, dengue and yellow fever that require equal attention. “March and April are crucial months when preventive measures such as fogging, fumigation and awareness campaigns are undertaken. Currently, this work is halted due to a nationwide lockdown. The peak season for malaria starts from May and a spike is seen after the monsoon, in July and August,” stated Dr Sudha, head, health and travel at Digit Insurance.

Malaria preparedness and testing

The World Malaria Report, published in 2018 by World Health Organization, says “India carries four per cent of the global malaria burden and contributes to 87 per cent of the total malaria cases in South-East Asia. India is in malaria elimination mode and has set targets to achieve a malaria-free status by 2030. Diagnosis and treatment of asymptomatic falciparum malaria cases continues to be a challenge for healthcare providers. To overcome these hurdles, innovative solutions along with the existing tools and strategies involving vector control, mass drug administration and disease surveillance hold the key to solving this gigantic health problem.”

Follow Indian Express Covid-19 tracker for latest updates

Pregnant women, infants, children under five years of age and patients with HIV/AIDS, as well as non-immune migrants, refugees, mobile populations and travellers are more susceptible to malaria and hence, they should take special care. However, there is certain similarity in symptoms of COVID-19 and malaria. The early symptoms of COVID-19, including fever, myalgia and fatigue, might be confused with malaria and lead to challenges in early clinical diagnosis.

Treatment and preventive measures

Treating malaria is an expensive affair especially if the patient requires hospitalisation due to associated complications or has been admitted with more severe forms of malaria. In case, senior citizens have been diagnosed with malaria, the chances of the disease affecting the patient’s vital organs become very high. In these cases, it is highly recommended to have health insurance for senior citizens to ensure that the costs of treatment are not alarming.

Right now, there are no vaccines which have been discovered for malaria but as a precautionary step, people can make use of mosquito bed nets, wear full-sleeved clothes and apply lotions on exposed skin. Anti-malarial drugs should be taken as prescribed by doctors. Malaria transmission occurs mostly during night because of the feeding habits of anopheles mosquitoes and taking precautionary measures against mosquito bite can help us to fight against this disease. Certain states that are more prone to malaria should not scale back on planned malaria prevention, diagnostic and treatment activities, advised Dr Sudha.

The need for medical insurance

Health insurance is highly essential in a country like India. With diseases on the rise and the cost of health care becoming prohibitive, medical insurance is a necessity for every individual. Malaria is not only physically debilitating, but it can also burn a hole in your pocket, especially if the patient needs hospital admission. Any health insurance plan with hospitalisation benefit will cover expenses related to malaria but people should always read the policy terms and conditions before buying their product. Insurance cost may vary as per location, hospital, city and severity of malaria disease and cannot be defined. A health insurance policy takes care of the finances as you recover.

Crude prices rose on Friday as energy producers continued to cut the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States and Canada.

Both Brent and the U.S. crude benchmarks, however, remained on track for their third straight week of losses as global production shutdowns failed to keep pace with the collapse in demand caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

U.S. energy firms cut the most oil rigs in a month in April since 2015, according to energy services firm Baker Hughes Co.

In Canada, drillers slashed the number of active oil and gas rigs to a record low.The oil market has experienced unprecedented turbulence since U.S. prices fell into negative territory on Monday for the first time ever and international benchmark Brent sank to two-decade lows.

Investors have sold oil aggressively since early March, in response to a 30% collapse in demand due to the pandemic.

This week’s declines will mark the eighth week of losses out of the last nine weeks.

Brent is on track for a 21% weekly drop and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) is set for a fall of around 6%.

Brent futures for June delivery rose 72 cents, or 3.4%, to $22.05 a barrel by 2:01 p.m. EDT (1801 GMT), while U.S. WTI crude rose 67 cents, or 4.1%, to $17.17.

Both contracts traded up over 5% earlier in the day. Storage is quickly filling worldwide, which could necessitate more production cuts, even after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, agreed to cut output by 9.7 million bpd earlier this month.

The global economy may still see a record contraction this year. “Despite the measures taken by OPEC, oil producers in various countries should be aware that they may be called to take more drastic measures,” Diamantino Azevedo, Angola’s resources and petroleum minister, told state news agency ANGOP on Friday.

Angola is a member of OPEC.Russia plans to halve oil exports from its Baltic and Black Sea ports in May according to the first loading schedule for crude shipments since it agreed this month along with other major oil producers to cut output.

Continental Resources Inc, the largest oil producer in North Dakota, has halted most of its production in the U.S. state and notified some customers it would not supply crude, people familiar with the matter said.

But with global storage space filling fast and oil demand shrinking by around 30%, those shut-ins are too little to rebalance the market. Onshore oil storage is currently filled to nearly 85% capacity, according to energy research firm Kpler.

In China, where the coronavirus outbreak started late last year, analysts said fuel sales should pick up in the second quarter as Beijing eases curbs to contain the pandemic.

Tripura Chief Minister Biplab Deb inspecting a hospital meant for Covid-19 patients.

Tripura’s second Covid-19 patient, a jawan from Tripura State Rifles (TSR), was released Saturday from the isolation center at the state-run GB Panth Hospital. Following his release, he appealed people to follow precautions advised by medical experts, and said coronavirus shouldn’t be taken lightly and people should stay indoors.

The state’s first coronavirus patient, a woman who returned from Kamakhya Temple in Guwahati last month, tested positive on April 6. Four days later, the jawan, who had traveled with the first patient in the same train compartment on his way back to duty from home in Madhya Pradesh, tested positive for Covid-19.

While the first patient was released on April 16, the jawan was released from the isolation center today after consecutive tests turned negative for coronavirus.

He was given a warm farewell this afternoon, before authorities moved him to a quarantine center where he will stay for the next two weeks to monitor any chance of relapse.

Speaking to reporters shortly before he was whisked away in an ambulance, the jawan said he received excellent service and care from doctors, nurses, other paramedic personal and government authorities during his stay at the isolation center.

As of now, Tripura is coronavirus-free after the only two patients diagnosed with the virus have recovered. But Chief Minister Biplab Deb has warned that the war against Covid-19 is far from over.

Deb wrote on Twitter: “Happy Moments. The 2nd and last COVID19 patient of Tripura got released from Hospital, where all the Healthcare staffs gave him a round of applause while he was leaving.He shared his satisfaction for the treatment received here and thanked the Doctors and Medical staffs.” He said the war against coronavirus is far from over and asked everyone to follow government guidelines.

“I thank all the frontline Warriors for making our State Corona free. The fight is not over yet. I urge everyone to follow the Government guidelines. Stay Home Stay Safe,” he added.

Tripura has announced a series of austerity measures to cut down on government expenditures in order to cope with the economic situation arising out of the Covid-19 outbreak.

According to a press statement issued Saturday, the Tripura cabinet decided in a meeting a day before to impose cost-cutting measures on all government departments, Public Sector Undertaking (PSU), cooperative societies and local self governments in urban and rural areas.

The state cabinet meeting mandated that all government office expenditures and other contingent budget expenditures would have to reduced by a minimum of 15 per cent. All departments were also asked to make “optimum utilisation” of contingent budgets of different centrally-sponsored welfare schemes, so that no pressure comes on the state government funds. All line departments of the state government were also asked to produce 10 per cent growth on their non-tax revenue collection.

In an effort to cut down on regular expenses in government offices and other facilities, employees were asked to depend on e-mail for official communication and avoid the use of paper. All departments, PSUs, autonomous organisations and cooperative societies were strictly instructed to reduce power bills and telephone bills by 10 per cent.

The cabinet took note of concerns by the 15th Finance Commission over per capita expenditure in terms of salary, pension and interest rates of few states including Tripura. The State Economy Board was asked to rationalise manpower redeployment to manage the expenditure load.

The statement also informed that any government fair, exhibition or public event would need the Chief Minister’s approval from now on. Even if such events were approved, they would have to be organised at a minimum expense.

No government fund can be used for land acquisition any more till the economic situation heals. For the time being, land acquisitions would only be permitted in case of public donations or gift deeds.

The state government would heavily depend on e-markets for all government purchases. Meanwhile, interest incurred from bank accounts held by different government departments would now directly go to the state exchequer.

As additional measures, use of air conditioners in government offices would be allowed only after permission from the State Economy Board. The Board was also asked to assess and regulate use of television, cable connections on offices.

A survey would be held on all Public Sector Undertakings (PSU) and “necessary steps” would be taken to reduce losses in loss-making PSUs to reduce financial burden on the government.

By Ashwini KR, Manisha Ninan & Tanusree Durairaj

The COVID-19 is on all our minds and we cannot deny how it has disrupted our routines. This disruption is not affecting just our students or families, but also the larger community that we live in. Anxiety is a normal, productive and valuable emotional response to the perception of threat. It is important to remember our children are looking to us for reassurance and cues on how to react and respond. An emotional response is normal. Asking ourselves and our children to not respond emotionally is impossible. We are working to address our own anxiety/fear and are helping our children do the same. Here are some strategies to build resilience, and have reassuring conversations with kids:

Anxiety is normal: It’s okay to show anxiety or fear; your child will pick up on this and also learn that this is a normal response. Changes to the environment and routines can create unease. Having calm, panic-free discussions can ease emotions around these changes. Check how your child is feeling and acknowledge and address their worries rather than ignore them. Keep in mind it’s okay to say ‘I don’t know’.

Stick to the facts: It is important to have thoughtful conversations regarding the COVID-19 to distill anxiety, worry or fear. Consider your child’s age, processing, and emotions to determine how to frame these conversations to ensure they understand. Check on what your child is thinking and address their worries. Discuss that not everything they hear or see is real. It can also be comforting to be reminded that doctors around the world are looking for ways to address the COVID-19 and highlight positive news as well.

Consider media consumption: When looking online, consider the source and fact-check to prevent fake news, and think before you share. Be mindful of how much media you are checking and minimise how often you are reading stories. Try to keep a healthy balance (both online and offline) in your daily routines and lifestyle.

Eliminate stigma: It is important to be aware of how the COVID-19 crisis is explained to your children to avoid any person/group being blamed and also to communicate that if someone has a fever or cough, it does not mean this person has the COVID-19 infection.

Implement strategies: It is possible to look at anxiety as a guide rather than a threat. Coping strategies can include: Any activity or interest such as singing, dancing, reading, drawing, music, Netflix/movies, creating a gratitude list, meditation, yoga, coloring, exercise, cooking/baking, talking to a friend or family member via social media, or doing other activities that are fun or give you joy and make you feel good. If you notice your child is still worried or anxious, be assured that this is a normal reaction, continue conversations and provide care for your child. If you find that additional support is needed, please reach out to counselors via email who can refer you to experts and schedule time on the internet with you or your child, to make a plan on how to support them during this time.

Read| Let’s imagine a brave new world: What is your Zihuatanejo?

Kids must have space to share fears: It’s natural for kids to worry. Could I be next? Could that happen to me? Let your child know that kids don’t seem to get as sick as adults. Let them know they can always come to you for answers or to talk about what scares them.

Read| Keep your kid busy with picture books; here are 10 recommendations

Help kids feel in control: Ensure your child does things that make them feel in control. Don’t forget basics like teaching them that they need good sleep and need to wash their hands well to help them stay strong and healthy. Explain that such activity helps stop viruses from spreading to others. Be a good role model and let your kids see you doing things that they can emulate. And good hand-washing is one of the most important if not the most important activity to handle COVID-19.

In conclusion, it can be said that as parents you have to remain calm and reassuring. Remember always that children will react to both what you say and how you say it. They will pick up cues from the conversations you have with them and with others. This imitation of adult talk and behaviour has to be handled very carefully as there should be no spread of negativity and misinformation. The effort always has to be towards building a positive and reassuring ambience.

By Dr Sumit Shinde

In today’s scenario, it’s mandatory for us to be locked down to save the population at large. In metropolitan cities everyone is conscious and stressed. But there is one more unidentified population which cannot express their sufferings. These are the families of kids with autism and other related disorders.

Autism is a neurological disorder in which a person is not able to communicate, socialise, are prone to repetitive behaviours and cannot adapt to a change in the environment easily. A majority of children with autism are fixated with daily routines and if not followed, they show irritability and disturbed behaviour. In severe cases they might show self-injurious or aggressive behaviour.

Read| Parenthesis: Parenting in the time of corona

To manage such a volatile situation, parents can play a vital role by following certain steps to reduce chances of a meltdown. It is important to understand the reasons behind the child’s behavioural issues.

Firstly, behind every repetitive behaviour there are some unidentified sensory or physical needs, which if not fulfilled, the child shows some repetitive traits to satisfy their needs. In our daily life, parents are not able to give close attention, to understand the therapist’s perspective closely. Now since we have more time, we should closely observe the traits to understand what exactly the child seeks to achieve, by showing such repetitive behaviour. If that need is satisfied with various activities then the child may stop such behaviour in time.

Secondly, many times children with autism show irritability, not because of some sensory or unidentified needs but because they are unknowingly provoked by parental expectations. Parents either want their kids to behave in a socially accepted way or try to provoke development, like training them to speak or pursue academics without understanding whether the child is ready to acquire it or not.

Most of the behaviours are also due to mixed messages. Parents sometimes have different opinions about their child’s behaviour so they handle it differently. This may also happen due to the affected interpersonal relations between couples.

Solutions

In today’s scenario we are all living a very sedentary life, in which families are away from academics, society and day to day work life. This is a good opportunity to understand family members and their interpersonal needs. Autistic children can do better if their non-verbal communication is understood by their parents. They also understand the non-verbal cues of parents. Very subtle non-verbal communication with autistic children can bring them back to better adaptability within the family. Parents can give little challenges to basic survival needs in a compassionate way, not by teaching them what to do but doing all those things passionately in front of them (that will help them understand their role in day to day task better) without keeping any expectations from them.

Parents should involve the kids in day-to-day chores by challenging their basic needs. Involve them in cooking, organising, cleaning, washing utensils and drying washed cloths. Orient them with what is kept where and its purpose.

Help them to associate with the things in their immediate environment and their purpose in day-to-day life. This is also the best time for parents to improve their interpersonal relations and their synergy will help them to work on their child’s overall development.

This is the best time to make their autistic child independent inside the house and integrate him/her with family members. This will help to ensure that parents can win the biggest battle to help children be more synergistic and compliant inside the house. So, when we come out of the lockdown situation, we can help them understand the outer world better than before.

Iran Coronavirus Tracker: As many as 87,026 people have been infected with the novel coronavirus in Iran, of which, 64,843 people have been recovered and 5,481 people have died. As of Thursday, it reported 1,030 new cases and 90 people had died since Wednesday.

According to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, its Health Minister Saeed Namaki said that in prior 18 days, the number of new patients have been reduced by 53 per cent and death toll by 30 per cent.

So far, Tehran Province reported highest number of cases at 5,098, followed by Isfahan Province at 1,979 and Mazandaran Province at 17,00 cases.

Markazi Province, Razavi Khorasan Province, East Azerbaijan Province are the only three regions that have reported less than 1,000 cases.

The number of deaths in the UK hospitals from the novel coronavirus crossed the grim milestone of 20,000 on Saturday, up by 813 over the previous day, among the highest daily death tolls recorded this week.

These official figures released daily by the UK’s Department of Health and Social Care do not account for deaths that occur elsewhere in the community, which means the overall number of COVID-19 deaths in the country is much higher.

Last month, in response to a question at the daily Downing Street briefings, Stephen Powis, the Medical Director of National Health Service (NHS) England, said a total number of deaths under 20,000 “would be a good outcome.” However, that figure has now been crossed within 51 days of the first UK death recorded from the coronavirus.

The government’s Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir Patrick Valance, had also said it was the “hope” that the death toll would be kept below 20,000.

The UK’s death toll now makes it just one of a number of countries to have crossed the 20,000 fatalities mark, after France, Spain, Italy and the US.

The deaths in the community are measured separately by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), based on death certificates, with a weekly figure announced each Tuesday.

It is estimated that thousands more will have died in other settings such as care homes, at home, in hospices, with the latest ONS data on that recording 1,662 COVID-19 deaths up until April 10.

Municpal workers , police and hospital staff waits for suspected Covid casualties at M R Bangur Hospital in Kolkata.

THE WEST Bengal government Friday said COVID-related deaths in the state numbered 57, of which 18 could be primarily attributed to coronavirus.

“Many questions are being raised on the audit committee set up by the state, and the death numbers. The committee submitted its report today, in which they said 57 people who died had tested positive for COVID-19. Of them, 18 persons died primarily because of coronavirus. The remaining patients had co-morbidities, but were COVID-positive, ” state Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha.

In a press statement, Biswaranjan Satpati, head of the audit committee and former director, health services, said, “The expert committee for conducting audit into the death of COVID-19 positive patients which was set up on April 3 has, till this date, examined 57 cases of death of persons who had tested positive for COVID-19. This committee examined all relevant documents, including bed-head-ticket, treatment history, laboratory investigation report, death certificates and other documents sent by the hospitals concerned, and found that 18 deaths were due to COVID-19 infections.”

It said, “The remaining 39 deaths were due to severe co-morbid conditions which were the immediate cause of death and COVID-19 was the incidental finding. The co-morbidities were cardiomyopathy with chronic kidney disease, renal failure, cerebrovascular-accident, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia, left ventricular failure and severe hypertension, multi-organ failure in Type-II diabetes and hypertension, red cell aplasia in a case of severe diabetes and hypertension, and severe diabetes with hypertension, hyponatremia.”

Apurba Chandra, who heads one of the Inter-Ministerial Central Teams sent to West Bengal, Friday wrote to West Bengal Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha and sought to know the system of declaring COVID-19 deaths by the audit committee set up by the state. Expressing displeasure with the explanation provided by the state Health Secretary, Chandra asked for the case records of all patients where the cause of death was attributed to some other cause.

A few hours later, the Chief Secretary revealed the contents of the death audit committee report. A senior state government official said, “The Central team put tremendous pressure on the Chief Secretary to make the report public. The state government then decided to make public the total deaths related to COVID-19.” To a question, the Chief Secretary said, “What made us share information is not important. Important is, what information we are giving.”

Further, 943 new samples have been tested in the last 24 hours, and the total number of tests has increased to 8,933.

“We got some complaints from different corners that many hospitals are denying care to non-COVID patients. We told them we will take strong action if any hospital turns away patients. They will have to give treatment, and if necessary, the government will step in,” the Chief Secretary said.

Apart from reiterating the need for social distancing and compliance to lockdown rules, a common thread in many of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s recent addresses has been the need for the country to be self-reliant.

On Friday, interacting with gram pradhans from across the country to mark National Panchayati Raj Day, Modi again underlined the need for the country to self-reliant. “The pandemic has thrown us new challenges and problems which we have never imagined, but it also taught us a very good lesson with a strong message. It has taught us that we have to be self-reliant and self-sufficient. It has taught us that we should not look for solutions outside the country. This is biggest lesson we have learnt.”

The Prime Minister’s call for self-reliance comes at a time when the pandemic has upended the world economy, with trade and manufacturing output facing an unprecedented decline.

Addressing the gram pradhans through video conference, the PM said, “Every village has to self-sufficient enough to provide for its basic needs. Similarly, every district has to be self-sufficient at its level, every state has to be self-reliant at its level and the whole country has to be self-reliant at its level.” He also appealed to panchayat representatives to ensure that every person in their panchayat downloads the app and uses it as a “personal bodyguard”.

Complimenting villages for showing the way with their simple definition of social distancing, he said the phrase “Do gaj doori (a distance of two yards)” has been a mantra used in Indian villages for social interactions.

This emphasis on self-reliance – a throwback to the traditional Sangh ‘Swadeshi’ line, which has often seen the party at variance with its ideological parent – has found an echo in almost all the addresses the Prime Minister has made since the country went into a lockdown in the wake of COVID-19.

While interacting with his Council of Ministers on April 6, Modi asked them to “strategise for emergent conditions” post lockdown. “While mentioning that… the country needs to lessen its dependence on other nations, (the PM) asked all departments to maintain an objective index on how their work will promote Make In India,” said an official press note released after the meeting.

The Prime Minister also pointed out that the crisis had offered India an “opportunity to become self-dependent in the medical sector” and urged the ministers to suggest new sectors where the country could become export hubs.

BJP insiders said ‘self-reliance’ was a factor in the government’s decision to back out of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Cooperation in the first week of November. Party leaders pointed out that reservations within the larger Sangh Parivar had played its part in the government’s decision.

In his annual Vijayadashami address, less than a month before the RCEP announcement, RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat had cautioned the Central government against yielding too much in the negotiations. Invoking BMS founder Dattopant Thengadi, Bhagwat had advocated the principle of Swadeshi and suggested that the country must “create and expand trade relations with the world on the basis of our strength and terms”. The RSS chief’s remarks on the economic slowdown and trade agreements had encouraged the Swadeshi Jagran Manch to raise its pitch against the government’s proposals on FDI, disinvestment and trade deals.

During his video call, the Prime Minister interacted with sarpanchs from seven states — Jammu & Kashmir, Karnataka, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra and Assam — and discussed their COVID containment plans.

On the day it red-flagged Ahmedabad, Surat, Hyderabad and Chennai among “major hotspot districts or emerging hotspots” and decided to send four new teams to monitor these cities, the Centre issued an advisory late Friday night relaxing curbs to allow functioning of select shops within and outside municipal limits. This will not, however, apply to Covid containment zones and hotspots.

Read| MHA revised guidelines for lockdown: Full text

In a fresh addendum to its April 15 lockdown guidelines, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued orders to exempt all shops in residential areas and market complexes in rural areas from the lockdown. Outside the municipal limits, which could be roughly translated as rural areas, all shops — barring liquor stores — can now open. Malls and large shopping complexes will remain shut in both urban and rural areas.

The order is likely to make non-essential items available to the public.

The MHA brought in two crucial modifications and inclusions which will act as enabling provisions to allow states open up their economy further. Under the Disaster Management Act, states are, however, free to reject these relaxations in certain areas if they feel it is detrimental to their Covid containment efforts.

Through the new order, the government has removed “shopping complexes” from the list of activities and establishments that are banned and replaced the same with “market complexes within the limits of municipal corporations and municipalities”. This is likely to virtually open up the small economy in the entire rural sector.

Under the category of commercial and private establishments that can now operate, it has included “neighbourhood shops and standalone shops, shops in residential complexes” in urban areas governed by municipalities. However, these are shops which are registered under “Shops and Establishment Act of the respective State/UT” which means liquor stores, which are registered under the Excise Act, and any other store governed by any separate Act will not be allowed to operate.

In urban areas shops in market complexes, single-brand and multi brand malls will not be allowed to operate. In areas outside of municipal limits, “All shops… including shops in residential complexes and market complexes” will be allowed to operate.

However, no more than “50% strength of workers” is allowed and “wearing of masks and social distancing” is mandatory.

Meanwhile, the Centre has placed under the scanner four districts from three states — Gujarat, Telangana and Tamil Nadu — which have together recorded over 5,000 cases.

The MHA said that apart from the new Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs), the one that is already monitoring Mumbai and Pune will also cover Thane, which has emerged as another area of concern.

Read| One month of lockdown: Covid spread widens, but concentrated in same areas

“The situation is especially serious in major hotspot districts or emerging hotspots like Ahmedabad and Surat (Gujarat); Thane (Maharashtra); Hyderabad (Telangana); and Chennai (Tamil Nadu). These teams would use expertise of the Centre and augment state efforts to fight and contain spread of COVID-19 effectively,” the MHA said in a statement.

The government had earlier deputed IMCTs to hotspots in West Bengal, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and MP. In Bengal, the move sparked a political firestorm with Central teams accusing the state of non-cooperation and the Trinamool government accusing the Centre of fighting with states.

Official district-wise data shows that Ahmedabad and Surat are the worst-hit among the new areas under IMCT surveillance.

Between April 1 and 22, the figures show that infections in Hyderabad and Chennai grew 10 and eight times, respectively. At the same time, it grew 40 times in Ahmedabad and Surat. Thane’s growth was relatively moderate at 23 times during this period.

Of these new cities, Surat has seen the largest spike in cases, from 48 to 338 between April 19 and 22.

As of April 1, the figures show, Hyderabad was on top among these cities, with 44 cases, and Chennai close behind, with 37. But over the three weeks, the two cities maintained a steady line, reaching 472 and 303 cases, respectively, on April 22.

Ahmedabad started out with 33 cases on April 1, and maintained lower numbers than Chennai and Hyderabad till April 12. But by Friday, it had eclipsed every district except for Mumbai, with 1,692 cases and 69 deaths.

The MHA statement said, “These teams would make on-spot assessment of situation and issue necessary directions to state authorities for its redressal and submit their report to the Central Government in the larger interest of general public.”

The latest move was announced on the day that marked the highest 24-hour spike in COVID-19 cases so far, with 1,752 infections recorded from an overall total of 23,452 cases.

According to the Health Ministry’s latest figures, the country has recorded 4,813 recoveries in all, with 37 deaths in the last 24 hours taking the total toll to 723. A total of 5,41,789 samples were tested till Friday morning.

Referring to these numbers, Dr V K Paul, NITI Aayog member (health), said that had there been no lockdown, the total number of cases would have been around 1 lakh.

Dr Sujit Singh, director of the National Centre for Disease Control, said that currently 9.45 lakh people are under community surveillance for suspected contact with positive cases. “Our weekly doubling time (of cases) has increased from 4.2 on April 6 to 8.6 on April 20,” he said.

And, in a video conference with state health ministers and officials, Union Health Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan said that stage three (community) transmission, when the source of infection is not easily traceable, has been avoided so far.

Dr Paul, who heads the empowered group on a medical emergency management plan, said that “had there been no lockdown, a reasonable estimate is that we would have now been at around a lakh cases…we would have been on the doubling time of three days”.

He said that “the good effects will keep showing till the first or second week of May… If we look at the three-day average, the doubling time is 10 days”.

Incidentally, the Ministry of External Affairs had earlier said that India could have had up to 8.2 lakh cases by April 15 without the nationwide lockdown. The Health Ministry had initially rejected the claim but then clarified that some modelling studies did come to that conclusion.

In his video-conference, Harsh Vardhan told state ministers and officials to not let their guard down for four more months at least. “Compared to all countries, our cases per million are the least, mortality too. Our recovery rate is very good. Our doubling rate is around 9 days…with a lot of belief, I am saying that we have definitely avoided stage 3,” he said.

With the addition of three more districts Friday, 15 districts on the COVID-19 map have not reported any fresh case in the last 28 days. A total of 80 districts from 23 states and UTs have not reported any new case in the last 14 days.

The Union Health Ministry has also asked states and UTs to ensure that all facilities under the National TB Elimination Programme (NTEP) remain fully functional, including diagnosis, treatment and provision of medicine for at least one month.

THREE days after the police arrested a 55-year-old political science professor for allegedly arranging stay of foreign nationals without informing the district administration, the Allahabad University on Friday suspended him.

“The university’s vice-chancellor R R Tewari ordered the suspension of professor Mohmmad Shahid on Friday,” said the university’s public relations officer, Shailendra Mishra.

He added that Shahid was suspended as per rules , as he has been in judicial custody for more than 48 hours.

Police arrested them after their medical report confirmed none of them found infected with coronavirus. Among the 16 foreign nationals – seven are from Indonesia and nine from Thailand. All 30 persons are lodged at a temporary jail after a local court sent them to judicial custody.

Police said Shahid is accused of allegedly hiding his participation in a congregation of Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi last month and arranging stay of seven Indonesian at a mosque in Prayagraj despite the lockdown.

He is also accused of not informing the district administration about the stay of foreign nationals.

On April 8, district officials went to his residence and put him and his family members in

quarantine.

The police in Shamli district have arrested 28 of 34 people accused of violating lockdown rules and participating in a panchayat meeting to decide if a local resident should be socially boycotted.

The accused are from Jalalabad town. They were allegedly angry after a person identified as Khurshid Qureshi cancelled his son Javed’s marriage, which was scheduled to take place in a neighbouring village on April 22.

The accused, feeling betrayed, alleged that Qureshi had deliberately called off the marriage without informing them as he had fixed his son’s wedding in another family.

Though Qureshi’s family maintained that the police did not grant them permission for the ceremony, the police claimed they had not been approached.

“We received information that a video had gone viral in which several people could be seen participating in a community panchayat,” said DSP Amit Saxena. “There was an issue regarding a marriage dispute which was meant to be solved by the gathering. The locals collecting at one place was against the lockdown rules and an FIR was filed in Thana Bhawan Police Station and arrests were made.”

The FIR was filed under Sections 188, 269 and 270 of the Indian Penal Code, and Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act.

With many Indians stranded overseas, S Jaishankar’s tweet also faced some criticism on social media. Mantel’s latest book is a 912-pager. With many Indians stranded overseas, S Jaishankar’s tweet also faced some criticism on social media.

External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar is clearly making good use of time during the lockdown in between diplomatic phone calls and official meetings. He has posted on social media that he has finished reading the trilogy of Hilary Mantel, the Booker Prize-winning English author. “A truly satisfying #WorldBook Day. Finally finished Hilary Mantel’s trilogy-The Mirror and The Light,” he tweeted. Mantel’s latest book is a 912-pager. With many Indians stranded overseas, the tweet also faced some criticism on social media.

Power Of One

Prime Minister Narendra Modi started his interaction with gram pradhans on Friday with reference to Mohammad Iqbal, a panchayat representative of Narwaw, in Jammu and Kashmir, After congratulating Iqbal for keeping in touch with the ground, Modi told him that initiatives of his panchayat have ensured that the village would be able to observe Ramzan properly. Modi also made it a point to include one of Iqbal’s mantras — respect all, suspect all — in the concluding remarks. Iqbal has said there is only one confirmed COVID-19 case in his block till date, and explained why even that solitary case emerged: “There is no panchayat constituted till date – we did not have panchayat members. Therefore, we could not trace the patient. We have identified and quarantined all those with travel history.”

To Patna Via Korea

With the pandemic expected to stretch out till the end of the year, the Election Commission has started looking at how it could affect upcoming elections. Bihar is slated to go to the Assembly polls towards the end of the year. The EC, in a preliminary meeting held recently, has decided to explore the South Korea model in this respect. South Korea conducted elections to 300 seats in its national assembly this month, and the poll panel has set up a committee of officers to study the changes adopted by that country in its polling process due to the pandemic.

Taking Stock

With the annual conference of military leadership to take stock of defence and national security issues cancelled due to the pandemic, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, who was to preside over the meet, interacted with leaders of the three forces to review their COVID-19 preparedness and took stock of the operational preparedness. Singh asked the forces to ensure operational preparedness to prevent any action from adversaries, avoid wasteful expenditure and mentioned that they should look at tasks that can be done quickly and can also help revive the economy when the lockdown is lifted.

A Tablighi Jamaat member housed in a temporary jail in Saharanpur district tested positive for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on Friday, 15 days after being deemed negative.

The Jamaat member in Saharanpur is from Kurla in Mumbai. He is among the 64 members of the organisation who were taken into custody due to the alleged violation of the Foreigners Act by some of them. Of the 64, 54 were foreigners and 10 were Indians, said officials. The Jamaat member tested negative on April 6, and completed his quarantine period before the new samples came back positive.

“When the initial list of Jamaat members was issued we found that several of them had violated tourist visa rules and were hiding in the district,” said SP (City) Vineet Bhatnagar. “There were 64 such people. Action was taken against them as per procedure and they were in a temporary jail. The person who tested positive did not have symptoms. He has now been sent to a government isolation ward. The area is being sanitised again and the other members are being quarantined.”

A 55-year-old man, who had tested positive for coronavirus three days ago, died on Thursday night, taking the total number COVID-19 fatality in the district to four. His wife and two sons have also tested positive are admitted in the hospital.

“The 55-year-old was admitted on April 21 evening and his condition did not show any sign of improvement since then. He had high blood pressure was diabetic for a decade. His immunity was already weak because of the prolonged underlying medical issues,” said Dr RC Gupta, principal of the medical college, where he was admitted to.

Since the son of the 55-year-old is a local BJP functionary and was involved in distribution of food packets for the last 15 days with BJP district unit chief, Mukesh Singhal, and two party MLAs — Satya Prakash Agarwal and Somendra Tomar — all the three BJP leaders were also tested for coronavirus.

“Their reports were negative,” said Chief Medical Officer (Meerut) Rajkuma. “23 areas have been declared hotspots in Meerut so far, and we are making sure that those living there do not face any difficulty in getting essentials,” said Meerut DM Anil Dhingra.

NINE migrant labourers who are back in Uttar Pradesh have tested positive in the past 24 hours, taking the numbers to 10 in the five-lakh odd that are estimated to have returned since the lockdown began. This could be one of the factors as Uttar Pradesh plans to bring migrant labourers back from other states.

Five of them are in Bahraich, three in Shravasti and one each in Balrampur and Bhadohi.

Shravasti Chief Medical Officer Dr AP Bhargava said all the three fresh cases in the district are of migrant workers who returned from Agra and Nagpur around mid-April. “The good thing is that all of them were kept in quarantine. We have not allowed anyone coming from outside to return to their homes. The man from Agra was kept at a primary school along with four others. The other two were in quarantine with at least 25 others. Samples of all of them have been sent for testing,” said the CMO.

So far, around 500 persons have entered the district from outside, he added.

In Balrampur, the man who tested positive had returned from Mumbai and was kept in quarantine with 40 others.

“The man had left Mumbai on April 13 with three of his co-workers. For some distance, they walked and then got a lift. They reached Balramnpur from Sidharthnagar border where they were kept in a primary school. From there, we brought them to a quarantine centre here. The man tested positive during random sampling. The three, who had accompanied them, have tested negative. All the four are asymptomatic. While there are more people at the quarantine centre, the three are considered to be his immediate contacts,” said Superintendent of Police Dev Ranjan Verma.

According to the SP, around 30,000 people have entered Balrampur district. “A lot of time, they enter the district through forest areas or along railway tracks. Only yesterday (Thursday), five people returned from Haryana. The silver lining is that people are becoming aware and inform us about the returnee migrants,” he added.

In Bahraich, the migrant workers who have tested positive returned from Nepal. Bahraich District Magistrate Shambhu Kumar said that one of them came via Punjab. “While one of them was at a quarantine facility, another was kept at a shelter home. The rest were hiding in their homes,” said the DM.

The first migrant worker to test positive in Uttar Pradesh was an 18-year-old, who had come from Bihar and was at a shelter home in Bhadohi district. He tested positive on April 10.

(Representational)

A war of words has erupted between the Trinamool Congress and the Railways after nine RPF personnel tested positive for COVID-19 in West Bengal, with the ruling TMC in the state questioning how the infected personnel travelled during the lockdown. The Railways has constituted a fact-finding committee to find out the circumstances under which these personnel got infected.

The personnel were part of a 28-member Railway Protection Force (RPF) contingent from Kharagpur division of South Eastern Railways, which had returned to the state from Delhi with a consignment of arms and ammunition in a parcel express train on April 14, the Railways said in a statement.

After a constable, who was part of the contingent, developed coronavirus-like symptoms, his swab was tested at a government facility on Thursday and the results returned positive.

Trinamool MP Derek O’Brien tweeted, “…They all came to Kolkata from Delhi on 14 April by train. Why were positive patients traveling during #lockdown? WHO SENT THEM ? Screening? How many people did they met?”

The Railways said there was no violation of the guidelines issued for COVID-19 management by the Centre or any state government, and that the RPF contingent had not come in contact with any members of the public.

South Eastern Railway (SER) has terminated the re-engagement of 90 retired employees citing reduced level of work and greater risk with those above 60 years of age. The move comes after the Railway Board in a video conference on April 21 advised zonal railways to look at ways to cut expenditure and explore termination of retired employees who were re-engaged from 2018.

Indian Railway has over 7,500 retired employees engaged in various departments and different levels. These retired employees were given full salary during their re-engagement. During the meeting, zonal railways were advised to explore termination at their individual capacity. The General Managers (GMs) are empowered to take a decision on the same. When contacted Chief PRO for South Eastern Railway, Sanjay Ghosh, he said, “At the time of their engagement it was mentioned that their services can terminated anytime. The move is being taken in consideration that the age group is more vulnerable to the present situation.”

After the termination of their re-engagement, the retired employees will get back to receiving their pensions as earlier. When asked if the decision was taken on the advice of board, Ghosh refused to comment. Meanwhile, in Mumbai both Central and Western Railway have not yet initiated any such move. “There are various ways to cut down expenditure, we are not looking at terminating retired employees,” said a senior railway officials from CR.

CPRO for CR, Shivaji Sutar said, “We are not undertaking any decision on terminating retired employees.” CPRO of WR, Ravinder Bhakar said, no such decision has been taken so far on WR.

Pointing to the number of industries that have begun operations and the sale of milk across the state, the state government on Friday claimed that the situation in Gujarat was fast returning to normal.

“Today, 49.28 lakh litres of milk was sold across Gujarat. The sale of milk is increasing. The average of sales during lockdown was around 45 lakh litres. This is an indicator that life is returning to normal,” Ashwani Kumar, secretary to Chief Minister Vijay Rupani. Before the lockdown, the daily average sale of milk was

between 50-55 lakh litres in Gujarat.

“Since April 20, about 40,000 industrial units with 5 lakh workers have started operations. The starting of industries in rural areas is an important step towards normalcy in the state,” he added.

The official said the farmers were bringing their agricultural produce to the 127 APMCs and since April 15, when the marketing yards reopened, over 4.4 lakh quintals of various foodgrains including wheat have been bought.

In the municipal corporation areas that have the maximum hotspots and containment zones, over 573 government works related to involving 20,000 workers have started in the urban areas.

Around 40 healthcare workers from AIIMS have been asked to self-quarantine after two nurses, one working in the department of gastroenterology, and a family member tested positive for coronavirus. Three doctors in the emergency ward at Safdarjung Hospital also tested positive.

Five healthcare workers have tested positive for the disease at AIIMS so far. “None of the healthcare workers who have tested positive were posted in the COVID-19 ward. All have contracted the disease from outside. We are tracing contacts of the workers,” said Dr D K Sharma, AIIMS medical superintendent.

The district administration has begun contact tracing. At a residential colony in Chhattarpur where one of the nurses lives, 225 people have been asked to go into self-quarantine. According to sources, there are “anywhere between 100-225 people” living in his building in Chhattarpur, of whom 80% work at AIIMS. “We will be screening the entire staff and a report will be sent to the authorities,” stated an order by the district administration.

In Delhi, over 80 healthcare workers tested positive for COVID-19. On Friday, healthcare workers from Lok Nayak, GTB, Jag Pravesh Chandra and Lady Hardinge Medical College tested positive for COVID-19.

A number of major global container shipping lines have started skipping country’s up container gateways, following the disruption caused at the major ports by the lockdown imposed by the Centre to check the spread of COVID-19. But this has not affected the number of commercial ships moving in the shipping lanes of the Indian ocean, which continue at the earlier levels of 11,000 to 12,000 ships at any given time.

Follow coronavirus LIVE UPDATES here

Major global container shipping lines, which include Maersk Line, Hapag-Lloyd, CMA-CGM and China Ocean Shipping Company (COSCO), are reported to have begun completely skipping the country’s top container gateways, including the state-owned Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust and Chennai port, and the Adani-operated Mundra port, industry players confirmed to The Indian Express.

“Due to the significant reduction in demand, we will be having blank sailings (sailings canceled by the carrier) from West Asia/Indian subcontinent to Europe and Mediterranean … and vice-versa,” said Maersk Line, the world’s biggest container liner, in a customer advisory dated April 3. Issues in clearing import containers from the ports and adjoining container freight stations, alongside the problems arising on account of the complete lack of export shipments from India, have ended up disrupting carrier schedules.

However, this has not affected the movement of commercial shipping in the major shipping lanes of the Indian Ocean, which are monitored round-the-clock by the Indian Navy’s IMAC. As per official sources, the number of ships in these lanes remain the same as earlier at 11,000-12,000 ships at any time. There are a total of 13 major ports in India which handled a traffic of 7.05 billion MT in FY20.

Immediately after the imposition of the 21-day lockdown, the Directorate General of Shipping imposed a 14-day quarantine on shipping vessels arriving from any port in China or any COVID-19-affected nation. While vessels arriving after 14 days of departure from a country where the virus had spread were not required to comply with the additional precautionary measures, those recording stoppages at any port of affected nations for refueling were not to be considered for the calculation of this 14-day transit.

As a result of these restrictions and complexities in the stipulated docking norms, “significant pile-ups” were reported at India’s major ports (state-owned) and key container transhipment hubs, an official involved in the exercise said. This was accentuated by the staff shortage at ports due to rotational rostering since the lockdown. Ports that were not able to comply with the specified requirements were simply told not to allow berthing for vessels that arrived within 14 days from the infected countries, which further added to the pile-up.

Compounding the problem further, some 70 per cent of truckers serving JNPT in Mumbai, India’s busiest container hub, have abandoned work and gone back to their villages following the outbreak and the subsequent clampdown.

Most of the private ports and terminals operating in the country have invoked the force majeure clause as most of them are involved in end-to-end contracts and operations were badly disrupted for a variety of reasons.

Mansara Apartment in Vasundhara Enclave will remain in lockdown like the rest of city, but residents will be allowed to go out to buy groceries or work if they are involved in essential services. The apartment complex was declared a containment zone on March 31, after a person tested positive on March 26.

“As per guidelines… the operation will be scaled down if no secondary laboratory confirmed COVID-19 case is reported… for at least four weeks after the last confirmed test has been isolated and all contacts have been followed up for 28 days… these two conditions are fulfilled,” said the order by the area DM A K Mishra. There are around 150 families here. “More areas are likely to be desealed soon,” an official said.

CM Arvind Kejriwal said: “Operation Shield was successful because of cooperation from people living in this zone.”

The cases have led to fresh concerns about shortage of PPEs and allegations of sub-standard safety kits being given to safai karamcharis.

Two sanitation workers of the South Delhi Municipal Corporation, deployed in Darya Ganj and Tagore Garden, tested positive for COVID-19 Monday. One of them, a 56-year-old, has a medical history and is on ventilator in AIIMS. Officials said he was not working in any containment zone. An assistant sanitary inspector with the North civic body, posted in Wazirpur JJ Colony, also tested positive, following which 39 sanitation staffers have been sent to home quarantine.

The cases have led to fresh concerns about shortage of PPEs and allegations of sub-standard safety kits being given to safai karamcharis.

According to the 56-year-old’s family, he had been working till April 15 despite having a history of diabetes and liver infection. “When he returned home that day, he said he was not feeling well. He was taken to Holy Family hospital in Okhla on April 18, and to AIIMS on April 19,” said his son.

He said corporation officials knew he had an existing liver condition and diabetes, as he had reached out to them last year regarding pending medical bills.

The man’s nephew, also an SDMC sanitation worker, said protective gear was hard to come by: “I have only got two masks and a pair of gloves till now. Sanitisers are hardly available.”

delhi sanitation workers ppe kits, delhi civic bodies ppe, ppe kits coronavirus, delhi safai karmachari ppe kits “I have strictly said that those above the age of 55 or with any underlying disease should not be on duty, but there have been cases where they are reporting to work. They do not want to be at home all the time,” she said, adding that she was enquiring about the case.

Leader of Congress Party in SDMC, Abhishek Dutt, said that if the man had underlying conditions, the corporation should have not made his curfew pass and asked him to come on work. “Every area and situation is risky for a safai karamchari, so all must be provided with PPE kits, not just those on COVID-19 duty,” he said.

Darya Ganj councillor Yasmin Kidwai said: “This is a fear we had from the beginning. I request the government to provide PPE kits.”

On the other SDMC staffer, a 48-year-old woman, who tested positive, an official said: “Nine of her colleagues have been asked to stay at home.”

On the ASI testing positive in Wazirpur, North MCD commissioner Varsha Joshi said: “As soon as he felt unwell, he went home. All his staff members are in home quarantine and family members are being tested. We are in continuous touch and will take every care till he fully recovers.”

Joshi said over 100 people are on duty in containment zones. “They wear PPE in every shift. About 60-70% are reporting for duty daily. About 10% are out as they are above the age of 55 and some others have underlying medical conditions.”

(Express photo) Residents of Old Delhi look out for the moon by the illuminated Jama Masjid as Ramzan begins, Friday. (Express photo)

The Delhi Police, Lieutenant Governor and Deputy Chief Minister Friday said azaan (call to prayer) would be allowed during Ramzan, which starts Saturday, though people must follow lockdown guidelines and offer namaz from home.

The clarification came after a video emerged showing two police personnel telling the muezzin of a mosque in Rohini not to play the azaan, citing an “order” by the L-G. “While observing roza and prayers, we expect everyone to follow lockdown as per the guidelines. Azaan may be carried out in accordance with NGT guidelines. It is requested that namaz be offered at home,” the Delhi Police tweeted.

The message was shared by L-G Anil Baijal, who further wrote: “It is requested that namaz may be performed while staying indoors, and have sehri at home.”

In the video from Thursday, a woman tells the two personnel, “Azaan ke liye koi mana nahi hai… Please show us the order. We will start fasting tomorrow, how will we find out the timings if the Imam doesn’t call for the prayer?”

A senior IPS officer from Rohini district said, “It was a miscommunication, and we have told the constables not to spread false information. It was a mistake since they got confused between azaan and namaz. Police personnel have been briefed again. We have also spoken to locals and told them that azaan will go on, and they must only do prayers at home. It is not banned.”

Deputy CM Manish Sisodia too tweeted: “There are no restrictions on azaan and people must not gather at mosques for Ramzan.”

In Dwarka, former MLA Adarsh Shastri claimed he had “received calls from people saying police are not allowing azaan in Mangolpuri and Pocket 8 of Dwarka”. DCP (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse denied the claim and said: “There is no restriction on playing azaan from mosques.”

A senior IPS officer said: “The basic difference between namaz and azaan has been explained. We will ensure that the holy month passes by smoothly in the midst of the lockdown.”

A Delhi Police spokesperson said the Rohini incident happened due to a “small communication issue”, which has been resolved. Anil Mittal, additional PRO of the Delhi Police, said, “We are in talks with religious leaders and priests. We want people to celebrate Ramzan indoors and not step out of their houses.” Video messages recorded with religious heads requesting people to maintain social distancing have been circulated on WhatsApp by Delhi Police.

Atul Kumar Thakur, DCP (South), said, “We briefed our staff a week ago and have already conducted meetings with imams and maulvis. SHOs and other police officers have also made announcements about the restrictions.”

There were 128 reported cases on Thursday and 138 on Friday. After a fall in the number of fresh COVID-19 cases in the city, the numbers have started to rise again. There were 128 reported cases on Thursday and 138 on Friday.

Delhi’s tax collection this April has dipped to a tenth of the collection in the corresponding period last year. Where Delhi collected Rs 3,566 crore as tax in April 2019, it has managed to get only Rs 323 crore till April 23 this year. Officials said that almost all the tax, under usual circumstances, flows in by the third week of the month.

The lockdown in Delhi began on March 23, two days before a nationwide imposition. Since then, only those involved in essential services and factories that manufacture essential items such as processed and packed food and medical equipment have been allowed to operate.

Hospital staff, bank officials, grain, vegetable and fruit mandis, grocery stores, takeaway services, e-commerce websites and pharmacists have been allowed to go to work too, since they are deemed to be part of essential services.

Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia, who is also the finance minister, said the situation is grim. “April was the first month where we could see a major impact of the lockdown and COVID-19, as by the time the lockdown was announced in March, most collections were already in. Tax collections are next to nothing,” he said.

Delhi’s budget of Rs 65,000 crore was announced in March, on the first day of Delhi’s lockdown.

Speaking to The Indian Express, Sisodia said: “Once we are over this, we will review sector-wise issues and see what the need of the hour is for each area. There is no point of a knee-jerk reaction when we don’t have a precedent or know what lies ahead. This is something that has not been seen in recent human history. There is no template, and conventional reform plans are useless.”

Talking about an extension to the lockdown, which is in place till May 3, Sisodia said it was too early to take a decision.

After a fall in the number of fresh COVID-19 cases in the city, the numbers have started to rise again. There were 128 reported cases on Thursday and 138 on Friday.

Sisodia said, “May 3 is still over a week away. We will have to take a call on extension closer to that. Right now, we plan to have consultations with the industry and all stakeholders as well as economists, but that can happen only if there is a pause to the rate of spread of the disease. Once there is a pause, we can shift the focus back to the economy. Right now all our focus is on COVID-19. But yes, if the government doesn’t have money, it will run out of money even for this fight. There are too many uncertainties right now.”

After the arrival of the internet, chess programmes erased the distance between players, getting them together on the same screen.

After working from home, the world is innovating playing from home. Not Ludo or rummy, not the sort of games which we play online to keep boredom at bay. The Royal Game is going on the internet, with 10 teams competing for the Online Nations Cup. Some of the biggest names will be playing from home next month, including Viswanathan Anand, Gary Kasparov and Vladimir Kramnik. Elsewhere on the internet, Magnus Carlsen, the biggest name of all, is hosting another tournament.

It had to happen. Chess was one of the first games to be played by computers and by the late Nineties, machines were capable of defeating the best human grandmaster. After the arrival of the internet, chess programmes erased the distance between players, getting them together on the same screen. But some resist the speed of online play and prefer an older method, with each player laying out the game on his or her own board at home, and communicating moves by email or in a chatroom. They channel an institution which turns 70 next year — correspondence chess, in which players send moves to each other, usually by post, and games last for up to two and a half years. It’s a radical variant of chess, since players are allowed to consult books, the internet and other reference material, and get a month of “reflection time” after every 10 moves.

The International Correspondence Chess Federation was established in 1951, but its predecessors go back to 1928. On the basis of dubious historical evidence, it is claimed that the first correspondence games date back to the 12th century, when moves were sent to opponents by homing pigeon. But it is certain that this form of slow chess shares a fundamental feature with the Online Nations Cup — both are based on absolute trust.

The state government on Friday issued show cause notices to over 150 teachers, who have refused to join the door-to-door survey – conducted to verify the beneficiaries of its scheme to provide Rs 1,000 to their bank accounts – after three teachers tested positive for COVID-19.

The Food, Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs department has also issued a directive to district education officer rural and city and administrative officer (AO) of AMC school board stating “asking them initiate necessary disciplinary action against teachers who have not started the work or are protesting against it” and told them to ensure that the work is completed by April 25 evening.

On Friday, several teachers in Ahmedabad protested against carrying out the survey amid the COVID-19 pandemic citing safety concerns. The move came after three teachers of Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) School Board tested positive, with one of them on ventilator support.

“Already three teachers have infected themselves during one such survey. One of them is on ventilator support. Thus, we demand PPE kits, no deployment outside respective zones of teachers and one policeman to accompany teachers as people do not allow us inside societies,” said Khodubhai Padhiyar, president of Ahmedabad District Primary Teachers Association.

The association representatives met the district education authorities and submitted these demands on Friday.

Over 1,000 school teachers in Ahmedabad city have been roped in for the door-to-door survey to verify details of over 1.67 lakh “unverified” ration card holders.

The government had announced a direct bank transfer (DBT) of Rs 1,000 amid the lockdown under its “Mukhyamantri Garib Kalyan Package” to over 68 lakh card holders, out of which, the goverrment found that, 26 lakh ration cards were “unverified”. A workforce of 17,000 employees, mostly teachers, were roped in to verify their details.

State health minister KK Shailaja congratulated the entire staff of the Kottayam Medical College for providing the best treatment to the couple.

Kerala Health Minister K K Shailaja speaks to The Indian Express on how the state managed to flatten the COVID-19 curve and why it is too early to rest. Excerpts:

Is the COVID-19 threat over for Kerala?

We don’t think the COVID-19 problem can be solved within a month. At present, our caseload has come down and there is good recovery. Another relief is that there was no community spread as a major chunk of the cases were people from Gulf countries and their primary contacts. At the same time, we haven’t reached a shore of comfort. Cases are going up in neighbouring states. In this scenario, Kerala cannot remain as a safe island. We have to continue our present vigilance and standard operating procedure. I have told our medical teams that we cannot rest considering the huge work before us. I have told them we may have to fight for the next four or five months.

What is the challenge ahead?

The return of expatriates would be a big challenge for Kerala. We are really distressed by the poignant experiences shared by people from the Gulf. In many bachelors’ camps, ordinary workers were telling me that they have symptoms but were not getting tested. We are ready to bring them back on a priority basis. Also, there are Keralites in other states, especially students presently held up in hostels. They also want to come back after the lockdown. Quarantining all these people would be an unprecedented challenge. We have to ensure enough stock of testing kits when there is a huge inflow of people into the state. Right now, we are handling less than 150 cases, but our planning is for tens of thousands.

How are you preparing for that stage?

We will have a strong screening system in the airport, stricter than the one before lockdown. More teams would be deployed to ensure that not a single person is left out of screening at airports. The symptomatic would be shifted to hospitals and the asymptomatic would go to their homes or common quarantine centres. Earlier, we had provided good facilities at quarantine centres. But in the next stage, when the number of people go up, we may not be able to ensure such facilities to everyone. We would have to convert auditoriums and educational institutions into quarantine centres. We had planned very well but the task is not so simple… Also, my job is to impart enthusiasm to the health workers and medical teams. Because medical teams have been working continuously for the last three months in batches.

How did Kerala manage to flatten the curve?

Our planning and preparedness are the most important factors behind our success. We had planned in advance. In early January, when I heard that a virus had been spotted in Wuhan, a high-level meeting of the health department was held. I could easily sense the danger because there are students from Kerala in Wuhan and some medical students had even approached me in the past for internships. I told the officials that the students usually return during February-March and hence we should be careful. After the 2018 Nipah outbreak in Kerala, reports of virus spotting anywhere in the world is a matter of concern for the state. On January 24, we initiated an action plan, which was taken down to all districts. That worked well and we handled very well all the three positive cases from Wuhan without any of their contacts getting infected.

How did you address the post-Wuhan scenario?

There was an impression that the virus attack was over. As no fresh cases were detected or reported anywhere in India, many advised me to lower the vigilance. But, we maintained a team at the airport for screening passengers although universal screening was not in place then. We got in touch with airlines to announce the screening at Kochi. Some even accused me of creating panic among people through such actions. The Opposition asked me to learn from America and follow that country’s mitigation method… If we had withdrawn that vigilance, the COVID-19 war fronts in Kerala would have multiplied. Only one family escaped our airport screening. We never remained complacent even when cases were not reported. We had trained doctors and other health staff and asked them to remain vigilant if persons with respiratory diseases turn up. When we strictly screened and quarantined people, I was blamed for over-action. But time has proved that Kerala is on the right track and is following the right SOP of screening, quarantining, isolating, tracing and treatment.

Is the threat of community spread over?

At present, there is no community spread. But, we cannot say the danger is over. Now our concern is about growing numbers in the Tamil Nadu districts bordering Kerala. Despite strong monitoring at the inter-state areas, several people from the affected Tamil Nadu districts are sneaking into Kerala. If virus carriers reach Kerala in this manner and go unnoticed, we would be facing the risk of community spread.

What about the danger of sudden spurt in cases from unexpected quarters?

So far, we do not see any such chance as we have already quarantined all persons with travel history and continue to test all symptomatic persons. We have already done pool testing, random testing and surveillance testing. Also, pneumonia cases have been tested, but no community spread has been reported so far. Only a few primary contacts of persons from abroad have tested positive. So far, no secondary contacts have tested positive.

Kerala has 16 labs with a total capacity to test around 2000, but only 500-700 tests are being held daily. Why?

We have scientifically planned testing. There are two reasons. If we test someone before he/she develops symptoms, there is no guarantee that such a person would not emerge as a positive case. Sometimes, the incubation period is long and goes beyond 14 days. Secondly, we have to use test kits judiciously. At the time of a pandemic, there is a scarcity of test kits as the entire world is demanding those kits. If we test thousands of asymptomatic persons, in case of an emergency situation demanding testing of hundreds of symptomatic persons, we may run short of testing kits. That would lead to a big crisis and things would go out of control. In many countries, that situation had emerged. Hence, we cannot leave people to fate.

What about the antibody test Kerala planned for one lakh people?

The antibody test is not fully reliable and would create a pseudo-confidence. However, we have not abandoned the antibody test plan. We had ordered kits from a Chinese firm. But, they did not supply at the last moment. Now, we have placed orders with another firm. ICMR had supplied 12,480 kits but when validation was done, some positive cases became negative. We have stopped use of it following ICMR directive.

Everyone is speaking about the Kerala model of combating COVID-19, what is that model?

We have a people-centred programme in which everyone is a participant. At the outset, we prepared our own protocol and standard operating procedure, which have been followed meticulously. Our state is cash-strapped, but with people’s support, we could bring changes in the health sector. Over the last four years, we could strengthen the network of primary health centres/family health centres with modern facilities and make them people-friendly through the AARDRAM Mission. We have seen MPs, MLAs, local bodies and even rich laymen financially supporting infrastructure facilities at government hospitals.

What has the health sector in Kerala learnt during the COVID-19 fight?

The biggest lesson is that people should be taught about responsible health behaviour. They should be made aware about proper health behaviour at the time of an epidemic. We will come out with an action plan towards that. Also, infection control methods and training would be strengthened in all hospitals. We are planning to stop unhealthy practices of visitors turning up at hospitals in large numbers. Our 62 hospitals have already got certification from National Quality Assurance Standards in the last four years. More hospitals would work towards that.

By Kshitiz Murdia

Fertility treatments and IVF are complicated enough, but when you throw a pandemic into the mix, it becomes a full-blown brain-scrambling, emotionally-draining and rage-inducing situation.

That’s the truth for hundreds and thousands of women who were waiting for an oocyte retrieval or embryo transplant during this period. For many, especially, those standing at the cusp of menopause, this could be their last shot at fulfilling their dream of becoming a mother.

A little delay, but a long wait

A majority of the couples planning to undergo IVF treatment have postponed their appointments. Others are delaying the date of embryo transfer till the fear of the pandemic dilutes down.

The novel coronavirus related delay in fertility treatment is mostly about waiting and delay. And that’s precisely the problem for most women who are seeking IVF in India. They have already waited too long to gain access to artificial methods of pregnancy, and right now, COVID-19 is putting their dreams back on ice.

What’s the risk of pregnancy in the times of COVID-19?

According to doctors, pregnancy is comparable to any other immune-compromised state and the risk of infection is much higher for pregnant women. Although they might be following social distancing protocols, they will need to visit the hospitals now and then for USG, health check-ups and/or C-sections.

These situations expose them to potential risks of COVID-19 infection. According to researchers, the novel coronavirus is a new virus and its effects on the health of a developing foetus or a pregnant woman has not yet been fully documented. Till date, there is no data on whether COVID-19 can cause miscarriages or congenital defects of the foetus.

Data from multiple districts of China show that novel coronavirus infected women did not pass the infection onto their foetuses, but most of them had preterm births, which may have been due to the COVID-19 infection, although no corroborative data is currently available.

Why is the small delay necessary for you?

While it might be difficult for someone waiting for their n-th round of fertility treatment or IVF, the delay can work in the favour of you and millions of others in two main ways –

– You will not have to go in for frequent clinic visits. That will enable you to maintain the norms of social distancing, which is the primary way of stopping the spread of the infection.

– If you are going to a hospital or research facility for your IVF treatments, you may be diverting medical professionals from more urgent cases that need their attention.

Is delaying fertility treatment compulsory in India?

Delaying fertility treatment in India is currently a voluntary choice. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has not released any guidelines or restrictions regarding the ongoing fertility treatments in the urban, quasi-urban or rural regions of the country.

However, at the same time, ante-natal and post-natal cares have been classified as essential services. Therefore, obstetricians and gynecologists’ can continue to see their patients unless one of them qualify for the criteria of self-isolation or quarantine. Telemedicine and telehealth are doing a marvellous task of filling the gap of personal visits with doctors and specialists.

Nonetheless, IVF requires special care and multiple visits to the clinic, which might expose the mother and the foetus to higher risks of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, medical professionals across the country are urging couples to rethink their pregnancy plans and reschedule their IVF treatment appointments until the imminent threat is over.
