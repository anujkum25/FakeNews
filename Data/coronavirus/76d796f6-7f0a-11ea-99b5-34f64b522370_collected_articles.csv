The death toll due to COVID-19 in India has risen to 377 while the number of positive cases across the country has neared 12,000. As Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the extension of the nationwide lockdown till May 3 but said the restrictions could be eased after April 20 in the least affected parts of the country to allow essential activities.

More than 32 crore poor people have been provided financial support worth Rs 29,352 crore as on April 13, the govt further added.

Meanwhile, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Wednesday issued consolidated revised guidelines on measures to be taken by Ministries and Departments of Government of India, state and Union Territory governments and authorities for the containment of COVID-19.

With the extension of the lockdown, the Indian Railways and the aviation regulatory body DGCA stated that rail and air services will also remain suspended till May 3.

MUMBAI: The number of coronavirus patients and deaths in Asia's largest slum Dharavi is rising by the day.

The fight here is being keenly followed. Spread across 613 hectares, the slum in the heart of India's 'Maximum City' houses more than 15 lakh people, with as many as five to eight people sharing a 100 sq ft room.

Social distancing is nearly unthinkable. “Lakhs of people are literarily crammed here. There is no proper ventilation, light and other basic facilities like water... We lack basic things,” social activist Rajendra Korade had told The New Indian Express recently.

The Mumbai slum saw a total of 60 positive patients being detected till Wednesday morning. Seven patients have died.

Dr Baliga Nagar of Dharavi saw five positive cases and two deaths.

Apart from this, two cases were reported in the Vaibhav housing society, 14 in Mukund Nagar, two in Madina Nagar and one in Dhanwada Chawl.

There were a further seven cases and one death in Muslim Nagar, six cases and one death in Social Nagar, seven cases in Janata Society, four cases and two deaths in Kaylanwadi, and one case each in PMGP Colony and Murugan Chawl.

There were also two cases in Rajiv Gandhi Chawl, four cases Shashtri Nagar, one case in Indira Chawl and one in Gulmohar Chawl. Nehru Chawl registered one death.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has identified nine contaminated locations in Dharavi and all of them are sealed.

Rahul Shewale, Shiv Sena MP from Dharavi said they have decided to check each and every area.

""We want to do this rather than wait for people to come to BMC hospitals. The BMC is going to their doorsteps and checking them. We are taking a proactive approach while dealing with this pandemic. In the next 10 days, we will complete these door-to-door health checks,"" he added.

Vijay Khabale, the BMC PRO, said that they have started an area clinic in every contaminated zone.

""A large number of people are voluntarily coming here and BMC is also going to each house and checking all residents of Dharavi. Therefore, we are seeing a spike in the numbers of coronavirus patients in Dharavi and other parts of Mumbai,"" said Khabale.

Talking of Mumbai, a total of 1351 coronavirus positive cases have been detected and 112 deaths reported till Wednesday. Those who tested positive include 100 health workers.

Worli, Prabhadevi, Byculla, Peddar road, Bandra, Andheri East and West, and Kurla are among the regions seeing more number of coronavirus positive cases.

The Maharashtra government has formed an expert doctors committee that is monitoring the hotspots.

""These health experts from various private and government hospitals are holding regular reviews and planning the strategy,"" a BMC official said.

PRO Khabale said that apart from health checks, they have started disinfecting all suspected areas.

""The police has been deployed in the sealed areas, so no one can go out and come inside. We have also told residents to make the list of essentials and are only allowing a few people from every building to go shopping. As per the Maharashtra government's demarcation of coronavirus-infected areas, Mumbai comes in the red zone. However, BMC has been working on a war footing to contain the spread of the coronavirus. We are expecting to see a dip in the numbers in the coming days. The curve will soon start flattening particularly in Mumbai,"" Khabale added.

Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is himself closely monitoring the Mumbai situation."

BHOPAL: All five persons who died due to coronavirus in Bhopal were victims of the 1984 gas tragedy in the Madhya Pradesh capital, an official said on Wednesday.

On March 21, some organisations working for the survivors of Bhopal gas tragedy wrote to the authorities concerned, saying such people were more vulnerable to the coronavirus infection than normal individuals.

""All the five persons who died after contracting COVID-19 here were victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy,"" the official said.

The Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Center (BMHRC), a dedicated facility for the treatment of gas mishap survivors, was recently turned into a medical facility for coronavirus patients, causing hardship to these people, Rachna Dhingra, member of the NGO Bhopal Group for Information and Action, told PTI.

The first coronavirus victim from Bhopal, a 55-year- old man, died at a city hospital on April 5 due to negligence of authorities, she alleged.

Another 80-year-old gas tragedy victim, who was a retired employee of the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), was also not given due medical care.

He died on April 8 and his sample came out positive for coronavirus on April 11, Dhingra said.

Besides, a 40-year-old gas tragedy victim, who was suffering from oral cancer for more than a year, died on April 12 and his sample test report later came out positive for coronavirus, she said.

Another 52-year-old gas mishap survivor, who suffered from a permanent injury, had history of tuberculosis and could not get prompt care for his respiratory problems.

He recently tested positive for coronavirus and died on his way to the COVID-19 ward at Hamidia hospital, she said.

Also, a 75-year-old senior journalist, who survived the gas tragedy, died on April 11 and his sample test report came out positive for coronavirus on Tuesday, she said.

On March 21, some organisations working for the welfare of gas tragedy survivors wrote to the state and central authorities concerned, saying an overwhelming number of gas victims suffer from respiratory, cardiovascular, kidney problems and cancer as a result of exposure to the toxic gas that leaked at the Union Carbide factory here in 1984.

They claimed that these survivors were at least five times more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other people.

Instead of paying special attention to the needs of Bhopal gas victims, the state government took over BMHRCand turned it into a medical facility for COVID-19 patients, Dhingra said.

For last 22 days, no gas victim was even allowed to avail emergency services there, she said.

Dhingra said before BMHRC was converted into a dedicated facility for coronavirus patients, 86 gas tragedy survivors were admitted there.

After it was made a hospital for COVID-19 patients, all except five were discharged.

Out of these five, a 68- year-old woman died at the hospital due to ailments related to the gas mishap, she said.

Besides, out of the gas tragedy survivors discharged from BMHRC, two persons, both aged around 70, died at their homes while another one died at a city hospital due to the gas leak mishap related illnesses, she said.

In a letter to gas relief hospital's monitoring committee chairman, retd Justice V K Agrawal, the NGOs pointed out all these aspects and urged him to re-start the medical facility for gas victims considering their vulnerability.

The NGOs have also filed a writ petition in the Madhya Pradesh High Court, demanding that gas victims be provided a dedicated medical facility for their treatment, as was the practice earlier.

Meanwhile, taking note of the death of five gas tragedy victims due to coronavirus, the state government has decided to categorise BMHRC as a 'COVID Health Centre' where gas mishap survivors can continue to avail treatment for their ailments.

An order to this effect was issued late Tuesday evening, a health department official said.

""Now, gas victims can continue to get treatment as usual in BMHRC, he said.

Bhopal Divisional Commissioner Kalpana Shrivastava said the earlier decision to make BMHRC a dedicated facility for COVID-19 patients was taken at the ""government level"".

Dhingra said the Out Patient Departments (OPDs) in other government hospitals of Bhopal continue to remain open for gas incident survivors.

Arif Aqueel, the former state minister of Bhopal Gas Tragedy Relief and Rehabilitation Department, said the earlier decision to close BMHRC for gas victims was not in the interest of these people, and they should be given treatment at this facility on priority, especially in the OPD."

SHILLONG: A senior doctor in Meghalaya John L. Sailo Ryntathiang, who tested positive for nCoV two days back, on Wednesday succumbed to COVID-19 registering the first coronavirus death in the hill state, officials said.

Confirming the death of the doctor, Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad K. Sangma said: ""I am deeply saddened to inform that the first COVID-19 positive patient in Meghalaya passed away this morning (Wednesday). My heartfelt condolences to his family and loved ones. May his soul rest in peace.""

Sixty-nine-year-old Sailo Ryntathiang, the founder of the private Bethany Hospital, breathed his last in the wee hours on Wednesday. He had tested positive for the coronavirus on Monday evening.

The Chief Minister in a separate tweet said that of the 68 swab samples tested so far, six have come out positive for nCoV and they are all family members and helpers of Sailo Ryntathiang at his private hospital. ""Six other cases are being re-tested. We are currently sanitising adjoining areas of the Bethany Hospital, particularly Nongrim Hills, near the hospital in Shillong,"" the Chief Minister said in another tweet.

Sangma said that a total of 90 samples have been sent for testing after the first COVID-19 positive case in Meghalaya.

The areas around Bethany Hospital in Shillong and Nongpoh have been sealed. Lists of the primary contacts of the doctor and the secondary contacts are being compiled.

The doctor had no travel history except that his son-in-law, who is a pilot, had been to COVID-19 infected countries, and had returned home on March 22. According to health officials in Shillong, the pilot, however, did not show any symptoms of coronavirus and was an asymptomatic case."

AHMEDABAD: Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani has decided to run the state administration without meeting anyone for next one week after a Congress MLA whom he met on Tuesday tested positive for coronavirus.

Rupani's health is fine and he will run the state administration through technological facilities like video conference, video-calling and tele-calling, Chief Minister's Office (CMO) secretary Ashwani Kumar said on Wednesday.

""No visitor will be allowed at the chief ministers residence for the next one week,"" he said.

Congress MLA Imran Khedawala, who met Rupani along with other party legislators on Tuesday morning, tested positive for coronavirus in the evening.

Kumar said Khedawala committed a big mistake by not staying at home and coming out to meet Rupani when he had given his samples for coronavirus testing."

Defence budgets across geographies to take a haircut

The world is now fighting a different kind of protracted war. Military experts predict that budget priorities for governments will be more about the coronavirus response and health systems, while their overall spending capacity gets hammered by the economic devastation caused by the outbreak. “It is too early to discern what the full impact of this pandemic will be for defence ministries. That it will have an impact, and a significant one, however, now seems beyond doubt,” wrote Douglas Barrie, Nick Childs and Fenella McGerty in a blogpost for the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Economists at Rand, the US policy research institute, said it appears that cuts are coming, as the US government’s “ability to purchase defense items is likely to fall.”

THRISSUR: After a meeting in the presence of ministers in the district, Cochin Devaswom Board authorities along with Thiruvambady and Paramekkavu devaswoms, decided to call off Thrissur Pooram entirely, in the wake of extension of the nationwide lockdown til May 3 amid coronavirus pandemic.

Even though preparations for the event, which was was set to happen on May 2, were stopped when the lockdown was announced, the organisers were hopeful about conducting the rituals. As the lockdown norms restrict gathering of not more than five people in temples, the meeting decided to avoid all rituals including flag hoisting for the pooram.

As there were confusions about pooram in the faction temples, the meeting also discussed it and decided to not conduct the pooram there also.

Drawing a large crowd including foreign tourists, Thrissur Pooram has a history of more than two centuries. Now, pooram fans around the globe have to wait for another year to enjoy Ilanjithara Melam, Madathil Varavu and the much appreciated Kudamattam. Fireworks display as a part of the pooram was another awaited feast, which the pooram lovers will miss this year."

NEW DELHI: Senior officials of the Railways on Tuesday said suspension of train services and other public transport is necessary to ensure social distancing which is the only way to prevent the spread of coronavirus.

Fearing a repeat of what happened in Mumbai earlier during the day when thousands of migrants gathered at Bandra railway station hoping to catch trains to their native places, the Northern Railway also issued an advisory.

""The general public is informed that a decision has been taken to not run any trains by Northern Railways till 3rd May 2020 in view of COVID-19, hence such fake news in circulation may not be believed,"" a Northern Railways spokesperson said.

The official also asked media persons to publicise that Northern Railways is not running any train from Delhi or anywhere else.

Amidst rumours that train services in the country will be resumed from April 15, the Railway Ministry also issued a clarification on Twitter.

""It is clarified that all passenger train services are fully cancelled across the nation till 3rd May 2020 and there is no plan to run any special train to clear the passenger rush.

All concerned may please take note of the same and help us in resisting any wrong news in this regard,"" the railway ministry said on the social networking website.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi Tuesday announced extension of the lockdown across the country till May 3 to fight the coronavirus pandemic, saying the measure has produced a significant outcome in containing the infection.

Even as the announcement stalled the prospective functioning of 15,000 passenger trains of the railways, thousands of migrant workers converged near the Bandra railway station in Mumbai hoping to catch trains back to their home states.

Railways, however, said all passengers will get full refund for tickets booked for the cancelled trains as well as for those booked in advance.

Sources said that after the Bandra incident, numerous messages were circulated on social media groups with false information that passenger train services will resume from April 15.

Some messages also suggested that railways will clear the rush of passengers, mostly migrant workers, in special trains, they said.

""The only way to prevent the spread of COVID-19 is by social distancing. Movement of public by public transport system cannot ensure social distancing. It is in this context that trains and buses are not being allowed to run in this crucial lockdown period. Even a single infected person travelling in a train can pass on the infection to thousands of passengers,"" a senior official of the railways said.

The official said in the early days of the spread of the pandemic, at least 12 cases were reported where those marked with home quarantine travelled in trains and could have spread the virus.

The official further said boarding and deboarding at different stations will continue to aggravate the situation further.

India has reported 10,363 cases of the virus and 339 deaths so far.

""With many trains running, this number will get multiplied manifold. Moreover, once this large no of people will reach their respective villages, the infection will spread there as well and it all will become unmanageable. The contact tracing will become impossible in such a scenario,"" the official said, adding that it was in public and national interest that social distancing be ensured at any cost.

Around 15,523 trains run by the railways have been affected due to the lockdown including 9,000 passenger trains and 3,000 mail express services which are run daily during normal circumstances."

KOCHI: The fight against coronavirus is going to be a long one and the pandemic will end only when a section of the population develops resistance, says infectious diseases expert Dr Anup R Warrier. Kerala has done well so far but now it all depends on how the state handles the situation once the lockdown is lifted, he tells TNIE in an interview.

So far, more than 9,000 people have tested positive in India. Do you think these numbers truly represent the spread of the virus? Where are we headed?

We are dealing with a global pandemic, and that means the disease can be present anywhere. This is a respiratory virus that is highly transmissible. Its endpoint is when the population develops herd immunity and the virus is no longer able to spread. But, till then it is a long haul and we have to wait and see whether we can go on with the advantage that we have gained now. It may take six to nine months -- till a part of the population acquires resistance.

Which stage are we as far as the pandemic is concerned?

Since we are dealing with a pandemic, we can talk about stages only from a global perspective. In this regard, we are in Stage 6 now. Hospital admissions and deaths are an important parameter of the severity of the disease.

But the numbers are low here compared to other countries. But, we seem to have missed the WHO alert. When WHO declared it as a pandemic, we should have closed international borders for all. Instead, we first blocked arrivals from China, and then Italy, while gates were open for the Middle East and Europe for long.

Do you think the lockdown has helped?

Yes, the lockdown has helped us to buy time for making necessary arrangements. ICU beds, PPE, testing kits, infrastructure and trained manpower -- all must be made ready. However, those working in the frontline are not supplied with sufficient PPE and masks even now. There is a supply issue and we are forced to learn to reuse masks.

India is seeing a large number of asymptomatic cases. Why do you think this is happening?

Asymptomatic and mild symptomatic cases are a danger. Such people help in spreading the disease and the scenario helps the virus to survive. It is not a trait specific to the coronavirus. Generally, all viruses have this hidden danger.

What do you think of the situation in Kerala?

Lockdown has benefitted us. There is no community spread yet. Now, it all depends on how the state handles the situation once the lockdown is lifted.

Compared to other states, the mortality in Kerala has been low.

The mortality rates cannot be compared unless we have all the details -- age profile, co-morbidity and stage of the disease etc. But an important factor here is the access to good healthcare in Kerala. Below particular social strata, access to healthcare is superior in Kerala compared to other states.

Do you agree with India’s testing strategy?

Testing can be done for treatment and also to know the magnitude of the disease. Since, we have mechanisms here to know where the disease stands, testing is not a concern.

Do you have any suggestions regarding the treatment protocol?

The treatment protocol may get stabilised in a month or so. We cannot authoritatively prescribe any particular medicine for Covid-19. Trials are progressing. Availability and familiarity of the drug is the key for using one now.

There’s lot of hype around hydroxychloroquine (HCQ)

HCQ is cheap, readily available and is a familiar drug. That is why it is being used widely. Clinical trials are going on. On an experimental basis, the drug can be used if somebody is suffering from pneumonia and the condition is worsening. In such cases, the risk from the disease is more than that from the drug. So, we can experiment."

KOZHIKODE: Strict enforcement is the whip Wayanad is using to tame the COVID-19 pandemic.

The district is not making any compromise and those violating quarantine directives are facing strict action.

The fact that one staffer each under the district collector and the district police chief was booked for violating curbs is proof enough of the administration’s zero-tolerance approach towards violators.

And it has worked. Despite facing several disadvantages – Wayanad is a high-range district sharing borders with Karnataka and Tamil Nadu – in containing the virus spread, the district reported just three positive cases of which two have been discharged. Of its eight lakh people, more than 12,000 were placed in home quarantine, a figure which has come down to 10,000.

A staggering 1,690 violation cases, including six related to spreading of fake news, were registered.

“Strict enforcement is key. We were on a roll since March 15 and case against the first violation of COVID-19 restrictions was registered on the first day which sent a strong message,” said District Collector Adheela Abdulla.

The festival at Valliyoorkavu Bhagavathi temple was a major violation. However, the organisers themselves approached the district administration to abandon it.

“It prompted others to follow suit,” she said.

In the following days, cases were registered against three mosque committees for conducting gatherings with more than five people in attendance.

The Wayanad district and police authorities also used the delayed geofencing method to detect quarantine-related violations.

“We monitored the highly mobile segment – people aged between 20 and 40 years – and realised that 50 per cent of them were violating the directives. The enforcement was tightened,” Abdulla said.

District police superintendent R Ilango said delayed geofencing is the method used to identify violators after four or five days and book them.

Wayanad also showed its magnanimity during the lockdown when it opened its borders to let 73 people from Karnataka and Tamil Nadu enter the district for health-related needs. Wayanad has 14 checkpoints and round-the-clock monitoring was ensured to prevent people from crossing the borders illegally.

The patients also did their bit. The first case, a Thondernadu native, arrived at Karipur airport, took a private taxi to his house. On the way, he asked his wife and children to go to his brother’s house.

The next person, a 29-year old man, arranged a car for him at the airport, which he drove home and placed himself in quarantine.

However, the third case, a Kambalakkad native, visited his brother-in-law on the way from the airport, mingled with family members and also with a person who came to his house for curtain repair.

They were all quarantined. At present, only the 29-year-old is in hospital and his first sample has tested negative.

‘Fight not over’

“While we can be relieved, the fight is far from over. Once lockdown restrictions are relaxed, many people will enter the district. This can be overcome through strict measures. At present, four COVID Care Centres have been identified as first-line treatment centres, while 135 hotels and other establishments will be converted into CCCs if needed,” said DMO R Renuka."

KOCHI: Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan deputed top cop Vijay Sakhare to the northern district of Kasaragod as a special officer on March 23, when it was emerging as India's biggest COVID-19 hotspot.

Three weeks down the line, the district is slowly turning into a safe haven for people, paving the way for a discussion on ""Kasaragod Initiative of the Kerala Police""-- a model that could be emulated in other heavily-hit areas in the country.

On March 31, the number of COVID-19 cases in Kasargod had touched 106.

They became 164 on April 6 and now in the last six days only 14 cases have been reported, a significant drop in the number of cases in the district.

""It was possible only because of our containment strategy. Basically our strategy was based on three locks-- Lock 1, Lock 2, and Lock 3 to ensure that the people do not mix up and infection does not spread,""Sakhare, who is the commissioner of Kochi city police told PTI.

Taking the charge as special officer, the Inspector General rank officer enforced three locks in the district in line with the lockdown measures taken by the central and state governments to arrest the spread of the deadly virus there.

The locks were put as part of a three-pronged strategy to completely isolate the persons who were primary and secondary contacts of the COVID-19 positive persons came from abroad, particularly Gulf countries, Sakhare said.

""Lock 1 was implemented doing traditional policing methods like road block and mobile patrolling and all. Through this measure we were able to control the people coming out of their homes"", he said.

The second strategy was implementation of Lock 2, creating a Geographical Infromation System, mapping all the positive cases, all home quarantined persons, all the expatriates who came from the foreign countries and primary and secondary contacts of the positive persons.

""Very interesting picture emerged. We saw that all the positive cases are concentrated only in seven areas of the district spread over five police stations. We isolated those areas by cordoning them off.

All roads leading to the areas were blocked and nobody was allowed to go in or come out,"" the IPS officer said.

The police then put the third lock, declaring the seven areas as Covid Containment Zones to isolate the worst-affected places from rest of the district.

Based on the inputs that COVID-19 positive persons who came from abroad had stayed at their homes, met their friends and mingled with family members, the police included all of them in the list of primary contacts and secondary contacts.

""After identifying these contacts, we put them under the Third Lock. They were locked in isolation using technology as well as traditional policing methods,"" Sakhare said.

""As part of the third lock, we put police guards in front of their homes. We created a beat patrol policing covering 10 to 12 houses of the affected persons.

Visiting their homes, the police personnel educated the people on importance of staying their homes"", he said.

Besides, all the houses, where the primary and secondary contacts resided were brought under the drone surveillance, Sakhare said.

He said COVID-19 safety apps were also installed in the phones of the primary and secondary contacts.

""If somebody tries to leave his home, then we get an alert. In that case, we go and shift such people to government quarantine facilities besides initiating legal actions against them.

Three days after implementing the third lock, we have moved 107 people into government quarantines because their actions were dangerous to the society. The app was installed in the phones of over 10,700 home quarantined people,"" the officer said.

The district police launched home delivery service in COVID containment zones to deliver essential items at the doorsteps of the people to ensure that they remained indoor.

The door delivery programme was later extended to all parts of the district.

The police also launched a 'Kasargod Suraksha App' to provide telemedicine to those isolated and wanted to consult with doctors for their various ailments.

The top police official said after April 14 upto April 21st ""we expect 12 to 14 cases only"" in the district.

It will further come down to single digit by the month end and ""four weeks from now I expect the case will be zero. No report of COVID cases,"" he added.

Out of the 166 who were infected in the district, 73 got cured. No fresh cases were reported on Monday."

NEW DELHI: A team of researchers at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, is working on a tool for diagnosis of COVID-19 based on respiratory, cough and speech sounds.

The tool, once validated, will offer a test which poses a minimum risk of exposure to the healthcare professional and can give the results faster than the current testing method.

The eight-member team has named the project for speech and sound-based diagnostics ""Coswara"", with an aim to detect and quantify biomarkers of the disease in the acoustics of these sounds.

According to the team, as the pandemic is growing in numbers, the development of simplistic, cost-effective and fast testing for infection has become a crucial component in healthcare, policymaking and economic revival of several countries.

""As the major symptoms of the disease include respiratory problems, the proposed project aims to detect and quantify the biomarkers of the disease in the acoustics of these sounds. The project requires participants to perform a recording of breathing sounds, cough sounds, sustained phonation of vowel sounds and a counting exercise. The entire response requires about five minutes of recording time,"" a team member told PTI.

""Along with these recordings, the tool also records the patient's health status as well as age, gender and location, without any personally identifiable information. The audio dataset collected will be released for researchers across the world to develop a potential diagnostic tool using signal processing and machine learning methods,"" he added.

The project being supervised by IISc faculty member Sriram Ganapathy is in the data collection stage and will go through an experimental validation before obtaining full approval as a potential diagnostic tool.

""Given the highly simplistic and cost-effective nature of the tool, we hypothesize that even partial success for the tool would enable a massive deployment as a first-line diagnostic tool for the pandemic.

The project is not aimed to replace the chemical testing or the imaging methods but to merely supplement those with a cost-effective, fast and simple technique,"" the researcher said.

Presently, the only approved form of diagnosis for a viral infection is reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of infected secretions.

""A real-time RT-PCR test is the most commonly deployed test currently for COVID-19 with testing results available after several hours. Generally, this test is carried out using a nasopharyngeal swab or a throat swab.""

""The major limitations of the testing which hinder the widespread deployment of this procedure include violation of social distancing which increases the chance of infection to the subject, exposure of the viral infection to healthcare workers, expenses involved in chemical testing and the time required for results with an increasing population requiring the test,"" he said.

According to Union Health Ministry, the death toll due to coronavirus rose to 377 while the number of cases in the country climbed to 11,439 on Wednesday.

While the number of active COVID-19 cases stood at 9,756, as many as 1305 people have been cured and discharged, and one had migrated, it said.

The total number of cases include 76 foreign nationals."

TUMAKURU: ""No one has died from COVID-19 under my care. One patient had cancer and he died of cancer,"" asserted Dr Arun Ranganath, who has been treating the intubated patients in the ICU of Maine General Medical Centre, Augusta, USA.

The physician who hails from here has treated five patients aged between 63-80 successfully and they have been discharged with one more person still getting treatment under his supervision

The expert doctor, who has had stints at hospitals in the UK, at Safdarjang in New Delhi, has been in Maine Centre for eleven years. For four years, he has been the director of the ICU and is triple board-certified in internal medicine, pulmonary and critical care.

Speaking with The New Indian Express, the shy doctor shared his experience as he has been working for over 14 hours daily at the 200-bed hospital. The young doctor says the best supportive care on a ventilator - with the pulmonologist, anaesthetist and intensive intervening at the right time - will make a difference as the rate of patient recovery will be high.

""We have also treated with some steroids, hydroxychloroquine, and azithromycin but I am not sure if it made a huge difference. I am not sure about their efficacy but at least they don’t hurt as some of the studies done in France show a mortality benefit,"" he explained.

Interestingly, the doctor's wife Nagaveni Thimmappa also works as a data analyst with the hospital as his colleague and the couple have risked their lives, leaving their little daughters aged twelve and seven years under the care of a nanny.

Hailing from Sira town, which witnessed a death due to COVID-19 and a positive case, Arun did his MBBS at Mysuru Medical College. Sadly, he lost both his parents Ranganath and Shivakumari in his childhood.

""My aunt, father's sister, Dr Jayalakshmi, working at the government hospital at Challakere in Chitradurga district motivated me to become a doctor. My paternal uncle Panduranga educated me,"" he informed.

He suggested that the shared responsibility is the need of the hour as the entire community including the doctors, the staff at the hospital and the public, in general, are at the risk of contracting the virus.

""There are definitely risks involved in the process. I can’t imagine any other better person than the physician to take that risk. On the same note, they have to protect themselves with appropriate masks and hand hygiene. They have to take care of themselves first to take care of others but that doesn’t mean that they should shy away from the responsibilities,"" he advised.

He also suggested that in a country like India, the general duty doctors at the hospital should also be trained in handling critical care including the ICU as soon as possible.

""India can just not relax as the cases detected are less but should keep in mind that there might be ten times more asymptomatic carriers and the latter should be subjected to diagnosis and kept in quarantine. Early detection is the key,"" he warned."

BRASILIA: A 99-year-old World War II veteran in Brazil was released from hospital with military honours Tuesday after recovering from COVID-19.

Second Lieutenant Ermando Piveta, who served in the Brazilian artillery in Africa during World War II, was brought out of the Armed Forces Hospital in Brasilia to a burst of trumpet music and applause.

Wearing an army-green side cap, he raised his arms in the air as he left the hospital after eight days as a patient.

""He won another battle, this time against the new coronavirus. He was released from hospital the same day Brazil is commemorating the 75th anniversary of its troops' successful campaign in the Battle of Montese in Italy during World War II,"" the army said in a statement.

Piveta served in the army's fourth artillery regiment, which trained in Dakar in 1942, soon after Brazil entered the war on the side of the Allies, the army said.

He then returned to Brazil with his regiment to defend the country from an Axis invasion that never came to be.

Brazil is the hardest-hit country in Latin America in the coronavirus pandemic, with 1,532 deaths so far."

A phone call sounds like such a small thing. But the sedated man in a Missouri hospital room was gravely ill with COVID-19, and nurses arranged for his family to wish him well, perhaps for the last time.

In another hospital, a guitar-playing nurse sings ''Amazing Grace"" outside patients' rooms. And in another, doctors show smiling photos of themselves so COVID-19 patients can see the faces behind the masks.

In a time of anxiety and isolation, simple acts of kindness from medical workers are giving comfort and hope to patients and their families.

That phone call arranged by a nurse at a St. Louis-area hospital let Erin Muth talk to her dad, Steve Blaha, for the first time in six days and just hours after doctors revived him when his heart stopped beating.

""Dad had basically died and we hadn't had a chance to say anything to him,"" said Muth, a nurse herself in Iowa. She tearfully told her dad, ""Thanks for everything you've done for me, rooting for me and cheering me on. I'm cheering you on now, Dad.""

Blaha, a machinist, turned 65 the next day, March 28, and though he remained sedated, Erin and her mom wished him happy birthday in a nurse-arranged video call.

Muth is convinced those calls gave Blaha strength. Days later doctors removed the ventilator and let Blaha breathe on his own. He's weak, but recovering.

Most people do recover from the new coronavirus. But it can be life-threatening for older adults and people with existing health problems. Many hospitals treating COVID-19 patients have adopted strict no-visitor policies and patients' only human contact is with masked and gloved medical workers.

""I'm afraid it might feel a little bit dehumanizing,"" said Dr Elizabeth Paulk, an attending physician at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. ""So much of our interaction with patients is nonverbal, and I think a lot of the warmth and humanity of the interaction is lost when you can't see someone's smile or their face.""

That's why Paulk decided to have her team make personal introductions, in simple paper printouts showing their names, color photos, and greetings in English and Spanish. Paulk's photo shows her with her two kids.

The message: ""We are complete people and we see them as complete people,"" she said.

At Saline Memorial Hospital in Benton, Arkansas, Katie Lea, chief nursing officer, knew the staff and patients needed to ease their stress. She recalled that one nurse plays guitar and sings at a local church.

Michael Stramiello gladly obliged. On work breaks, wearing a blue surgical mask, he strums and sings at the nursing station and in the corridor, loud enough for patients to hear in their rooms.

Religious songs are his favorites, but at a patient's request he played ""You are My Sunshine.""

Stramiello said everyone is feeling ""a bit more anxiety"" because of the pandemic.

""Music has always been my personal therapy relief,"" he said. ""It's a different approach to being a nurse, for sure. It makes me thankful to be able to do it."""

NEW DELHI: For advocate Rohan Sharma, seeking bail for his client to take care of his ageing parents was a tough task as he first had to first convince the registrar concerned for listing the case by explaining the urgency and secondly he had to smoothly conduct the hearing via video conferencing.

Though the Supreme Court of India has started functioning smoothly via video conferencing, but the use of technology is still a huge challenge at the high courts and district court level.

On Monday, the top court’s two different benches heard at least 50 plus cases via video conferencing but if one looks at the data available at trial court level, it is quite low and just 15-20 cases are being heard via the telephone.

An additional sessions judge posted at a Delhi court who did not want to be named said, “We are feeling handicapped by not utilizing technology which is available around us as the court infrastructure doesn’t support it. During a bail hearing on Monday, I used my own phone to hear the arguments via video call to the lawyer concerned and this is happening in most of the cases.”

Though the process of providing a videoconferencing facility through e-courts platform is underway, the lawyers can use Cisco Webex for the facility in the interim period.

“If the Advocates/Litigants/Police/Public Prosecutor are not equipped to conduct the hearing from their locations, the facility for video conferencing shall be made available in the Judge’s Conference Room and the Computer Branch shall facilitate such a hearing,” the official order passed by the District Judge stated."

SEOUL: In a surprisingly high turnout, millions of South Korean voters wore masks and moved slowly between lines of tape at polling stations on Wednesday to elect lawmakers in the shadows of the spreading coronavirus.

The government resisted calls to postpone the parliamentary elections billed as a midterm referendum on President Moon Jae-in, who enters the final two years of his term grappling with a historic public health crisis that is unleashing massive economic shock.

While South Korea's electorate is deeply divided along ideological and generational lines and regional loyalties, recent surveys showed growing support for Moon and his liberal party, reflecting the public's approval of an aggressive test-and-quarantine program so far credited for lower fatality rates for the coronavirus compared to China, Europe and North America.

""We are going through difficult times, but the coronavirus and politics are two different things,"" said voter Lee Kum.

Another Seoul resident, Chung Eun-young, said she arrived at her polling station just after 6 a.m. to avoid crowds.

""I was worried about the coronavirus,"" she said.

""They checked my temperature and handed me gloves, but it wasn't as bothersome as I thought it would be......I don't like what we are going through, but I cast my ballot to prevent the wrong candidates from getting elected.""

The long lines that snaked around public offices and schools followed record-high participation in early voting held on Friday and Saturday, and defied expectations of low turnout to minimize social contact.

The National Election Commission said 15.6 million people had voted as of 5 p.m.

When combined with the 11.8 million who cast their ballots during early voting or by mail, the overall turnout was at 62.6%, the highest since a 60.6% turnout in the 2004 general election.

Wednesday's voting, which comes amid a slowing virus caseload in South Korea, draws a contrast with an upended election cycle in the United States, where some states have pushed back presidential primaries or switched to voting by mail.

To hold the parliamentary elections as scheduled, South Korean officials and health authorities drew up a deliberate set of preventive measures to reduce risks of the virus being transmitted.

Duct tape or stickers marked a meter (3 feet) of social distancing space from nearby streets to ballot booths.

Masked poll workers checked temperatures of arrivals and whisked anyone with a fever or not wearing a mask to separate areas to vote, sanitizing the facilities after they voted.

Voters who passed the fever screening got sanitizing gel and disposable plastic gloves before entering booths.

The government also mapped out a voting process for those quarantined in their homes, a number that ballooned after the country began enforcing two-week quarantines on all arrivals from overseas on April 1.

Officials texted eligible voters in self-quarantine before the vote and about 13,000 affirmed they wanted to participate.

Those without fever or respiratory symptoms were given permission to leave their homes from 5:20 pm to 7 pm so they could cast their ballots after 6 p.m., when polling stations close for other voters.

They were to be escorted or monitored through tracking apps and must maintain a 2-meter (6-foot) distance at polling places, while workers fully dressed in protective suits were to disinfect booths after each of them votes.

Hospitalized patients or those who were then under two-week quarantine were able to vote by mail if they had applied in late March.

Around 400 of the mildly ill voted at temporary shelters during last week's early voting.

South Korea has confirmed more than 10,590 coronavirus cases, including 225 deaths, with the number of new infections decreasing in recent weeks.

But there's concern about rising cases in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, and worries that crowds at parks and on mass transportation may be a sign of a relaxing of social distancing.

""Please do exercise your valuable rights by voting, but also refrain from other gatherings or activities that involve multiple people in confined spaces,"" Health Ministry official Yoon Tae-ho said.

South Korea's 300-member parliament, the National Assembly, is elected every four years.

Voters directly elect 253 district seats while the remaining 47 go to proportional representatives.

While dozens of parties have registered candidates, the elections are seen largely as a two-way race between Moon's ruling Democratic Party and the main conservative opposition United Future Party.

Both have registered satellite parties in a bid to win more proportional representative seats.

Just three years ago, mass protests ousted Moon's corrupt predecessor, but public displays of South Korea's dynamic democracy were muted this year by the virus.

Candidates, wearing masks and gloves, avoided large rallies and handshakes.

Things were more heated on the internet, which overflowed with bitter exchanges between supporters of Moon and his conservative opponents, who accuse the government of economic and foreign policy failures and botching the financial response to the epidemic."

NEW DELHI: With India’s nationwide lockdown set to continue for another two weeks until May 3, over two-thirds of India’s heavy duty trucks and nearly 90 per cent of its entire road freight capacity are likely to remain idle.

Industry representatives say that unless exemptions on movement restrictions are expanded to more industries, there will be little improvement in demand and a steady worsening in the financial health of its stakeholders — big and small.

Following the announcement of the lockdown extension, the country’s apex road transport union — All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) — said that their worries have only increased. AIMTC Core Committee chairman and former president Bal Malkit Singh claimed that despite the Prime Minister’s call for cooperation, even some public sector units are rescinding work orders. ""Corporates and public sector undertakings should honour their existing work contracts as the livelihood of many others depends on them,"" Singh commented.

With most non-essential industrial activity coming to a halt during the lockdown, demand for freight transport has plunged. Only the gradual expansion of industrial activity can bring back demand, industry representatives say.

According to the Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training (IFTRT), the lockdown has taken out over 75 per cent of road freight demand out of the picture. “60 per cent of the road cargo pie comes from the manufacturing sector, another 10-15 per cent from infrastructure and export-related activity. These sectors are hardly operating now,” pointed out S P Singh, senior fellow, IFTRT.

The impact of an extended lockdown on India’s freight transport and logistics segment could be quite severe if lockdowns extend till mid-May, a McKinsey report noted. According to the research agency’s analysts, the contraction in output between the last quarter of FY2019-20 (January-March) and first quarter of FY2020-21 (April-June) could be as much as 40-45 per cent.

With the freight and logistics sector contributing around 8 per cent of India’s GDP and employing around 22 million people, the impact of a full month’s lockdown extension will be substantial.

This is why the AIMTC has sought several relief measures from the government to aid the smooth functioning of the sector, Singh said. Among those demands is the allocation of around Rs 200 crore for assistance to drivers on the move.

“The government must use its reach and resources at the district level to set up a place every 200 km to where stranded trucks on the roads due to disruption of supply chains can be sanitised and allowed to move on,” Singh said, adding that the Centre should also extend an insurance cover of Rs 50 lakh for drivers who contract the disease while ferrying essential commodities."

CHITRADURGA: Timely and effective action helped Karnataka reduce the spread of COVID-19, said minister of health and family welfare B Sriramulu here on Tuesday. The state which was in third position in terms of the number of cases in March has now dropped to No.12, he added.

""Each and everyone from grassroot level Anganwadi workers to officials to ministers to the Chief Minister worked as a team to ensure public health and safety and the result is visible,"" he said.

Requesting the public to take up the extension of the lockdown till May 3 as a challenge, he urged them to follow the guidelines and ensure their own safety as well as the safety of society.

No one in the state should sleep hungry and it is the responsibility of society to help the administration overcome the present crisis, said Sriramulu. He also assured the destitute and needy that food items would be provided to them.

Suggesting that the public use cloth masks, the minister said N-95 masks should be used by medical staff treating COVID-19 patients. Using these masks unnecessarily results in a shortage for healthcare staff, he added.

Lauding the all-women Chitradurga district administration in handling the COVID-19 situation and ensuring zero cases in Chitradurga, Sriramulu directed the police to seal the borders of state with neighbouring Andhra Pradesh so that no one with the virus enters Karnataka. He also requested officials to be liberal with farmers and allow the movement of agricultural and horticultural crops freely to the markets."

MUMBAI: India head coach Ravi Shastri has termed the ongoing fight against COVID-19 crisis as a ""mother of all World Cups"" which the countrymen have to win at all cost by coming together.

On Wednesday, Shastri posted a video on his Twitter handle wherein he urged people to adhere to the guidelines of the government in order to stop the spread of coronavirus.

""Today the COVID-19 has put us in a situation where we got our backs to the wall,"" Shastri said.

""To combat this coronavirus is like chasing a World Cup where you give your everything in trying to win it. What's staring you at the face is no ordinary World Cup. This is the mother of all World Cups where not just eleven are playing but 1.4 (1.3) billion are in the playing arena and competing.

""Guys we can win this. For that, we have to observe the basics. You have got your Prime Minister leading from the front ahead of the curve like other countries have farmed out,"" Shastri added.

The India head coach further said people need to pay respect to the frontline workers who are risking their lives in this fight against coronavirus.

""You have to obey the orders that come from the top: be it Centre, state or the frontline workers who are risking their lives.""

Shastri said during the lockdown which has now been extended till May 3, people need to stay at home and maintain social distancing.

""It is not easy but to win the game you got to go through the pain to break the chain and see the gain,"" said the 57-year-old.

""Come on, guys! let's do it together. Let us get out there in a bruit force of 1.4 billion (1.3 billion) and beat this coronavirus and get your hands on the World Cup of humanity. Let's do it,"" he added.

Over 11,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus have been reported till now while more than 370 people have lost their lives in India."
