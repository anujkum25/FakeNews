Hyundai ramped up domestic production to as much as 98% of capacity by late March, not only as the Korean market was recovering from a bad February but also because it bet on demand for Tucson SUVs and other models from U.S. customers, its biggest overseas market outside of China.

(Also read: Hyundai India integrates 500 dealerships under 'Click to Buy' platform)

While Hyundai is one of few global automakers whose production has recovered at home, its exports optimism has been dampened by the severity of the U.S. outbreak, weak consumer sentiment and as rivals have quickly moved to guard their turf.

Consignments of cars shipped from South Korea are now sitting in U.S. ports, with dealers slow to take deliveries because of slumping sales and rising inventory, four people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.

The company idled a Tucson production line at home last week for five days, while sister firm Kia Motors is looking to suspend three Korean plants for a week. And analysts now expect a sharp drop in first-quarter operating profit when it reports results on Thursday and some even forecast a second-quarter loss.

""I hope that the situation will recover by the middle of next month. If not, we might have to lay off some people,"" said Brad Cannon, general manager of an exclusive Hyundai dealership in California, whose sales are down more than 50% from when the pandemic started.

Hyundai runs a factory in Alabama - which is closed until May 1 - but imports are key to meet U.S. demand. Only about half of its vehicles sold in the United States are made in North America compared to between 68% and 85% for Japanese rivals Toyota Motor, Nissan Motor and Honda Motor, who have also suspended production there till May.

The South Korean company makes about 61% of its cars overseas, up from 48% a decade ago. That leaves it vulnerable to overseas factory shutdowns and shrinking demand outside of its home market.

Hyundai's South Korean factory operation, which had recovered from a component shortage from China to nearly 100% capacity by March, could fall to as much as 70% in April, the company recently told analysts.

""We will continue to monitor the situation and take appropriate action promptly,"" Hyundai said in an emailed statement.

MINIMISING IMPACT

American rivals like GM and Ford have been quicker than Hyundai to launch financial offers in the United States. (REUTERS)

For its part, Hyundai has taken measures to minimise the impact.

In March, Hyundai relaunched a job-loss protection programme introduced during the 2008-09 global financial crisis in the U.S. market, offering to cover up to six months of payments for car buyers if they lose their job due to COVID-19 this year.

It has also revamped its model lineup, in a move reminiscent of the car maker's success in 2009 when Hyundai was the only major automaker to post increases in U.S. sales through a revamp of the portfolio and aggressive marketing campaigns.

But rivals, which were in turmoil a decade ago, are not standing still this time around. Detroit's big three - General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler - have been quicker than Hyundai in launching attractive financial offers, propelling them to their biggest combined market share since 2006 in late March-early April, according to researcher J.D. Power.

""I think the market has changed… I don't think it will be like 2008. The other makers may be not as aggressive, but pretty much right there,"" Scott Fink, the operator of Hyundai’s biggest U.S. dealer, said. He expects his dealership to post a 40% sales drop in April compared with an 18% decline in March.

While not optimistic about a quick market recovery, Fink said Hyundai would be still able to resume sales and market share growth, driven by new products like the Palisade SUV.

RECOVERY AT HOME

Still, demand recovery at home, Hyundai's biggest market, is expected to cushion the blow from the slump overseas, with South Korea's new COVID-19 cases dropping to nine on April 21 from a peak of 909 on Feb. 29, without drastic measures such as lockdowns.

Hyundai's domestic sales in March hit their highest level in more than four years, up 80% from February, helped by a consumption tax cut. Hyundai also said local pre-orders for new models like the Elantra and Genesis G80 are strong.

On Saturday, a Hyundai Motor dealership on the outskirts of Seoul was busy, with a steady stream of mask-wearing customers going in and out.

""Customer traffic has fully recovered to the pre-virus level,"" said Lee Taek-san, the store's general manager, adding some 40 groups are now visiting the showroom on a holiday, from 10 in early March. ""It is a relief,"" he said.

With factories shut and people asked to remain indoors, the auto industry has taken a massive hit from the national lockdown in place to check the spread of Covid-19. Kia has said that it has been evaluating the situation and has explored various options through which its dealers in the country can be supported.

(Also read: Kia Motors' exports hit hard, three plants in South Korea may be shut down)

Kia has considered the option of support on interest cost of dealer stock, including vehicles in physical and transit stock. It has also said that untilised dealer funds lying with the company have already been remitted back to dealer’s current account. Additionally, all the accepted service claims for warranty have been credited to the dealer's account.

Kia has also announced that warranty payments have been credited to dealers and priority clearance within 15 days post lockdown for all dealer invoices.

Kook-Hyun Shim, MD and CEO at Kia Motors India, has said that the dealer network in the country is one of the key pillars that the company stands on and looking out for them is priority. ""We are committed to offer our continued support in these testing times and will undertake all necessary steps to help them (dealer partners) navigate through the situation together with us,"" he said.

The company, much like Hyundai has already done, is also looking at strengthening its online sales channel in order to add convenience as well as reduce physical interaction points.

Kia made its India debut in 2019 and has raced to be one of the top-selling auto companies with its highly-successful Seltos SUV. At Auto Expo 2020 in February, the company launched the Carnival MPV and is preparing to drive in the Sonet compact-SUV to further consolidate its position here."
https://auto.hindustantimes.com/auto/news/ferrari-rolls-out-coronavirus-testing-to-get-staff-ready-for-work-41587449911669.html,"Workers at Ferrari are signing up en masse for voluntary coronavirus screening so they can return to work as soon as possible in an ambitious scheme that could serve as a blueprint for manufacturers desperate to resume production.

Under its ""Back on Track"" project, Ferrari staff, families and suppliers first take blood tests to see if they're clear and will then be given an app which will alert them if they've been in close contact with any scheme members who contract Covid-19.

As manufacturers in Europe and North America scramble to find ways to restart their businesses while keeping the virus out of production sites, Ferrari's scheme to test workers and track possible cases of Covid-19 is being closely watched.

The aim is to ensure only healthy staff resume work but if someone does get the disease, their close contacts will be alerted by the smartphone app to stay away from the plant until they've been given the all clear.

""We've all understood we're not indestructible,"" said Alberto Zanetti, head of the UILM union in northern Italy's Modena province, which is home to Ferrari's Maranello plant. ""Workers want to get tested.""

Ferrari said 500 out of the 4,000 workers at its Italian plants in Maranello and Modena had already taken tests and the company had the potential to do about 800 a day.

""This screening will allow us to take an initial picture of the health status of the tested company's population,"" said Ferrari's head of human resources Michele Antoniazzi, adding that almost everyone offered a test had agreed to have one.

(Also read: Ferrari's 'Made in Italy' lung respirators to challenge 'faulty' Chinese supply)

The blood tests show whether an employee is healthy, or might be infected. In the second case, they then need a swab test to confirm whether they actually have Covid-19.

Under the scheme, Ferrari will also give specific insurance coverage to those hospitalised after testing positive and will arrange temporary accommodation and medical assistance for anyone who has to self-isolate.

For now, Ferrari's plants remain shut along with other businesses in Italy deemed non-essential. But the carmaker says its scheme developed with virologists will help provide a safe working environment as soon as restrictions are eased.

ANONYMITY GUARANTEED

Union boss Zanetti said the aim was to protect individual production units from the spread of the virus and that he expected more than 90% of employees to take tests. ""Other companies are calling us to see how it works,"" he said.

(Also read: Automakers push to reopen plants with testing and lots of masks)

Ferrari only produced just over 10,000 of its luxury sports cars last year so its initiative might not easily transfer to bigger automakers that churn out millions of vehicles a year.

However, Ferrari Chairman John Elkann is also chairman of auto giant Fiat Chrysler and he said Ferrari would share the project results. Exor, the holding company of Italy's Agnelli family, controls both companies.

Gaetano Gargiulo, who works in the R&D department in Maranello where prototypes of Ferrari's ""Prancing Horse"" supercars are built, said he had taken the blood test.

""I did it early in the morning and by 4 p.m. I'd received the response on my mobile,"" said Gargiulo, who is also part of an internal safety group appointed by fellow workers. ""I was very happy to do it, for me and my family. I know that many colleagues are pushing to do it as soon as possible"".

Gargiulo is also optimistic his fellow workers will agree to adopt the smartphone app when it's launched. ""People are looking at it as a positive thing. As they agreed to take the blood test, they'll also use the app,"" he said.

Ferrari's app adheres to an European initiative called Pan-European Privacy Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT), which is designed to track transmission chains of Covid-19 without infringing individual privacy.

The Ferrari app was developed by tech startup Bending Spoons in Milan, the same firm picked by the Italian government to create a national tracking platform as part of efforts to lift the nationwide lockdown.

Antoniazzi said the app would only track contacts users have had with others in the scheme using Bluetooth technology and would not record movement. Data collected will also be managed by a company outside Ferrari.

""People will be guaranteed anonymity and therefore privacy.""

Russia, with more than 47,000 confirmed coronavirus cases so far, has imposed a partial lockdown and closed car dealerships in Moscow, where sales are highest, and in some other regions.

(Also read: Russia orders companies to cut oil output by 20% from February levels)

The most popular cars are usually mass market models like Lada or Renault, though there is also demand for expensive cars from companies such as Daimler or BMW.

Sales data shows the rouble devaluation that resulted from collapsing oil prices encouraged Russians to rush to showrooms in the last week of March to buy cars before an expected price hike. But that was a one-off, experts said.

""Due to the rouble's weakening we can expect the market to shrink by 20%, but taking into account the lockdown, the fall may be 50%,"" Denis Petrunin, head of ASC Group, a big Russian car reseller, told Reuters.

That means the Russian car market, which once promised to be the largest in Europe with annual sales of almost 3 millions cars, is expected to fall to less than one million this year from 1.76 million in 2019, according to the Association of European Businesses.

Such low sales hark back to the Soviet era and to the post-Soviet 1990s, when most Russians were too poor to buy cars, data provided by Russian analytical agency Autostat shows.

Russia's car market was looking weak this year due to depressed incomes even before the oil price slump and the coronavirus lockdown.

Because most cars sold in Russia are imported or assembled from imported components, their prices, denominated in roubles, are set to rise.

""Now, everyone is staying at home and not getting paid. People who aren't sure about their future salary and whose businesses have closed are not considering buying a car,"" Autostat’s Executive Director Sergei Udalov said.

The proportion of cars bought on credit has increased in recent years and reached 50%. That could now fall three or four times, said Nikolai Gruzdev, head of Avtomir, one of the country's largest dealerships. A halving of the market was a realistic scenario, he added.

""Will people be willing to buy cars after the lockdown and at new prices? It is a big question!"" said analyst Vladimir Bespalov of investment bank VTB Capital.

So far, neither the union nor the automakers have announced a deal. But the Detroit automakers all are aiming to restart at least some U.S. assembly plants in early May. Virtually all U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of Covid-19 infections grew rapidly.

The safety practices and sick leave policies the automakers and the UAW agree to would offer a template for auto suppliers and potentially other manufacturing industries.

UAW president Rory Gamble wrote on Friday the union has made it clear to the car companies that adequate testing for Covid-19 is key to restarting production and ""we must create an environment where workers are comfortable to self-report symptoms and self-quarantine, without penalty.""

Bernie Ricke, president of United Auto Workers Local 600, which represents workers Ford Motor Co's Dearborn, Michigan, pickup truck plant and at a number of auto suppliers, said automakers and suppliers have assured him they will allow self-quarantine without sanctions.

""They'll have a policy that if people aren’t feeling well they should just stay home,"" Ricke told Reuters. ""That's the message I've got from all of them: They're going to protect people.""

Automakers and the UAW said they were unable to comment on the negotiations.

Dennis Earl, president of UAW Local 14, which represents more than 1,500 workers at GM's Toledo transmission plant, said discussions also have included providing enough face masks and shields for workers.

""Until they have enough to provide a clean, new mask every day for everybody, I would oppose any opening of the plant,"" Earl said.

A General Motors Co spokesman said the automaker was in discussions with the union on a wide range of issues to ensure worker safety. GM has begun producing protective equipment for distribution to hospitals and its own staff.

Bruce Baumhower, president of UAW Local 12, which represents around 11,000 workers, including about 6,000 at a Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV Jeep plant in Toledo, said he was relying on the UAW's health and safety department to negotiate terms for reopening.

""The calendar is not going to have anything to do with when we start up,"" Baumhower said. ""It's going to be when the conditions are safe.""

Talks over restarting two Ford plants making SUVs and pickup trucks in Louisville, Kentucky, have included hanging welding curtains between workers who have to work less than six feet (1.83 m) apart and keeping them apart at break times, said Todd Dunn, president of UAW Local 862, which represents more than 12,000 hourly workers at the plants.

""It's a dynamic situation and it changes daily,"" Dunn said. ""Each day we see a new plan.""

Ford has targeted a May 4 restart for the pickup truck plant, but Dunn said ""no one has signed off on that plan yet.""

A Ford spokeswoman said the company will adapt practices from the plants it has opened to make ventilators, masks and face shields to help fight the pandemic.

Those measures include having workers pass through scanners to check their temperature, separating shifts to prevent workers from crowding together and cleaning plants between shifts.

That steep decline, far greater than anticipated earlier this year, likely will cost global automakers 19 million units in lost production in 2020, according to LMC Automotive, which warned those projections could slip further, depending on how quickly major regions recover.

In North America, where most vehicle production remains shut down in April, automakers have been forced to delay introductions or planned ramp-ups of several new vehicles, including the Tesla Model Y, the Ford Mustang Mach E, and redesigned versions of Fiat Chrysler's Jeep Grand Cherokee and General Motors' full-size SUVs, LMC said.

The analyst said it expects vehicle sales will bottom out in April in North America and Europe, with post-pandemic recovery ""unlikely to be rapid"" in the coming months.

China, which was among the first countries hit by the novel coronavirus, already has restarted most of its auto plants and now expects to see a sales decline of just 12% this year, LMC said.
