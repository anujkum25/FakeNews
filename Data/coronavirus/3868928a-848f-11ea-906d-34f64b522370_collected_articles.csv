Declared as a pandemic, coronavirus has been spreading geographically at an exponential speed. The first case of the coronavirus was identified in Wuhan, China. Since then, the disease has spread across countries like the United States, Italy, Africa, Japan, India, etc.

As a parent, you want to do everything possible for protecting your babies and toddlers from coronavirus. Here, we provide you with six tips to do the same:

1. Teaching and practicing hand hygiene

There is still so much that we donâ€™t know about the coronavirus and how it is spreading. However, the one thing that every expert agrees on is that maintaining good hygiene is important. Your child learns by watching you. So, you have to follow good hygiene habits like washing your hands the proper way, not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, and covering your nose and mouth while sneezing. Make your child wash their hands after coming home, using the toilet and before eating. They should be washing their hands for 20 seconds with soap and water.

Using a hand sanitiser is not as good as washing your hands with soap and water. It is not even able to get the visible dirt off the hands of your child, let alone the germs. Also, sanitisers only work if they dry, which your child might not be patient enough for. So, it is important that you donâ€™t rely on a hand sanitiser before letting them eat. However, in case of emergencies, hand sanitisers can be used.

2. Remind your children not to shake hands

It is important that you avoid handshakes to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. You might think that it is not important to remind your child to avoid this, but this is a common practice among young children. Tell them why they need to avoid this so that they have a better understanding of what is going on.

3. Stock up on the essentials

If your baby is small, you need to stock up on essentials like wipes, diapers, and some over-the-counter medications. If your child has asthma, make sure that you have a couple of spare inhalers. Buy the necessary medical supplies and the prescribed medications. Apart from the medicines, you should also buy two weekâ€™s worth of baby food like cereal.

4. Avoid going into highly-trafficked places

Coronavirus spreads via the air in tiny droplets that are produced when a person affected by the disease breathes, coughs, sneezes or talks. When people are within six feet of each other, viruses spread more easily. If you live in an area where there has been a confirmed case of coronavirus, you should avoid going out altogether, especially to highly trafficked places like malls or libraries.

5. Clean your home regularly

To protect your baby and prevent the spread of coronavirus, clean your home continuously, especially the areas that are highly used. This includes toys, phones, tablets, staircase railings, and the refrigerator door. For maximising effectiveness, the surface should be left wet for 15-30 seconds.

6. Maintaining cough/respiratory hygiene

While coughing, make sure to use a tissue. Throw the tissue immediately. If you donâ€™t have one, you can bend your elbow and use it for covering your mouth. Teach your child to do the same.

China has reported 30 new COVID-19 cases, a majority of them are the Chinese returning from abroad, taking the number of imported infections in the country to 1,610, the health officials said on Wednesday, as the authorities stepped-up the testing and treatment facilities in all border regions.

The death toll due to the novel coronavirus remains 4,632 with no new fatalities were reported on Tuesday, while the overall confirmed cases climbed to 82,788, of which 1,005 patients are still being treated and 77,151 have been discharged, Chinaâ€™s National Health Commission (NHC) said.

Chinaâ€™s imported cases have risen to 1,610 with 30 new cases, including 23 imported infections. Of the total imported cases, 811 people are being treated with 41 in severe conditions, it said.

A total of 42 new asymptomatic cases, including seven from abroad, were reported on Tuesday, taking the total to 991 asymptomatic cases. All of them were under medical observation, the NHC said in a report.

Asymptomatic cases refer to people who are tested positive for the coronavirus but develop no symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat. They are infectious and pose a risk of spreading to others.

By Tuesday, 1,029 confirmed cases including four deaths had been reported in the Hong Kong, 45 confirmed cases in Macao SAR and 425 in Taiwan including six deaths, state-run Xinhua news agency reported.

China has scaled-up testing and treatment for COVID-19 infections in border areas as the country faces a rising risk of imported cases.

With an over 22,000-km land border dotted with 91 land ports, along with a large number of shortcuts and side routes, China faces a high risk of coronavirus importation via its land border, Xinhua report said.

However, the medical service capacity in some border regions is relatively insufficient for the epidemic response, Guo Yanhong, an official with the NHC told media on Tuesday.

The NHC has instructed the countryâ€™s nine provincial-level regions with land ports to make targeted response plans in a bid to intensify containment efforts and get prepared for imported cases, Guo noted.

Describing the epidemic control in border areas as a priority in the current stage, Guo said that the commission had conducted a thorough assessment of the capacity for laboratory testing and medical treatment in border cities.

Groups of medical professionals and epidemic containment experts have been dispatched to some border areas facing a mounting challenge of imported cases, such as Suifenhe, a border city in northeast Chinaâ€™s Heilongjiang Province.

Meanwhile, the essential medical equipment, including mobile P3 laboratories, computerized tomography (CT) scan machines, have also been sent there to improve the local ability to detect and cure COVID-19 infections, Guo said.
