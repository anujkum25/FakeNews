COVID-19 has already proven to be an unprecedented disaster, with a much broader impact than any other disaster in the history of mankind, be it the loss of human life or economic loss. In India, due to COVID-19 outbreak, the central and state governments have imposed restrictions on businesses across industries. Due to nationwide three-week lockdown and social distancing, businesses are facing various operational constraints, resulting in severe disruptions and temporary closings. The result is huge business losses for various businesses.

Companies, in India, having Business Interruption Insurance will rely upon them in funding the recovery of their loss due to COVID-19.

This article explains what this insurance typically covers, and whether losses caused by COVID-19 are or will be covered by BI?

What is Business Interruption Insurance?

Whenever any losses incurred due to an insured peril to an insured business establishment or property or machinery, the fire and machinery policies compensate for the loss of property. However, when a property is damaged, the affected industry may not be able to carry out business. But the industry or the business may still have to pay salaries, rent, and incur other operational charges. Further, the profits that one would have otherwise made are also lost. All these losses are covered by Business Interruption Insurance.

What is covered under a Business Interruption Insurance Policy?

Business Interruption Insurance can be issued as a separate stand-alone policy, but in India, it is incorporated in Fire Policy or Machinery and Boiler Explosion Policy. It offers protection to the net profit, standing charges, and an increase in the cost of working to maintain normal output or turnover.

Whether losses caused by COVID-19 are or will be covered by insurance?

Recently, it has come into media that insurers and top companies are likely in for a tussle regarding claims arising out of COVID-19 outbreak; and quite a few companies are eyeing claims under the ‚Äúloss of profit‚Äù clause in their insurance contracts.

For the business interruption cover to trigger, according to industry pundits, it is necessary for the property insured to suffer physical damage due to a covered peril such as fire, flood or earthquake, and hence, such policies would not cover loss caused due to COVID-19.

In India, Business Interruption Insurance is not sold standalone and is dependent upon property coverage. BI cover in India can be taken as a separate policy only in conjunction with fire insurance or as part of a package in products such as industrial all-risk insurance which covers both property damage and business interruption. Hence, if a claim is triggered on property damage, only then is the Business Interruption Insurance cover triggered.

The Business Interruption Insurance Policy‚Äîbeing a consequential policy‚Äîalways has a condition that insurer must have first accepted liability under the fire policy before any claim is settled under this policy. Therefore, unless there is an underlying fire or machinery policy, an insured will not be able to enforce a claim.

Another reason, which may be given by the insurer to reject any COVID-19 claim is that insured has not made any contributions by way of premium for covering such a loss.

Though the courts in the US have consistently held that if a condition makes a property uninhabitable or deprives the insured of use of the property, that condition will constitute physical loss or damage, the applicability of those decisions in India may be seriously challenged, firstly, because of the specific wordings of the insurance contracts in India, and secondly, the US decisions would only be applicable in cases of presence of COVID-19 at the insured property. However, in India, the business establishments are closed not due to the presence of COVID-19 at their premises but due to the lockdown enforced by the government authorities. In these circumstances, it is highly improbable that the Indian companies having Business Interruption Insurance will be able to take benefit from the US case laws.

The Supreme Court of India has while interpreting the insurance contracts held that the terms of the policy will govern the contract between the parties (Shree Ambica Medical Stores and Ors. vs. The Surat People‚Äôs Co-operative Bank Limited and Ors. (28.01.2020 ‚Äì SC). In interpreting insurance contracts, the constitution bench of the Supreme Court (General Assurance Society Ltd. v. Chandumull Jain: AIR 1966 SC 1644) has held that the court must interpret the words in which the contract is expressed by the parties because it is not for the court to make a new contract, however reasonable if the parties have not made it themselves.

Therefore, the court through its interpretative process cannot rewrite or create a new contract between the parties, and the court must simply apply the terms and conditions of the agreement as agreed between the parties.

Therefore, the financial loss will be paid by the insurers only if the terms and conditions of the relevant policy provide for that and not otherwise. Given the long line of decisions of the apex court of India that court has to simply apply the terms and conditions of the agreement as agreed between the parties, it will be difficult for the companies having Business Interruption Insurance cover to argue that the loss on account of business interruption due to the COVID-19 should be paid by the insurers.

But despite the aforesaid challenges, there is every likelihood that some of the insureds will approach the courts for claiming the loss suffered on account of business interruption due to COVID-19. It will be quite interesting to see how the courts deal with such claims and interpret the insurance contracts in a situation like COVID-19 which is peculiar; and whether the courts deviate from their strict interpretation of insurance contract standard to help insureds to get their claims by expanding the interpretation of ‚Äúphysical damage‚Äù to include COVID-19, on the ground of legitimate public purpose, even though the relevant policy does not have the express extension to COVID-19 like situation.

This Arunachal Man Is Spreading COVID-19 Awareness And People Are Now Helping The Poor There

As India continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic with lockdown in place, many people are being the good samaritans and helping people, one way or the other, in these times of desolation.

Twitter

In Arunachal Pradesh, a documentary filmmaker and journalist, Kamtey Ringu, is doing his bit - not only is he providing daily updates to people and raising awareness on COVID-19, but he is also helping raise the concerns of slum dwellers and poor in Itanagar.



Occasionally, Ringu is also providing a helping hand in distribution of food.

His videos on Facebook are being viewed by thousands of social media users and it has also led to people chipping in to help those in need of food or any financial assistance. He is doing his job as a journalist and also playing his part as a citizen.

Ringu runs a small media firm working under the name of Himalayan Watchdog. He and his team have being reporting from various parts of the state and lending voice to the voiceless and helping draw attention to their needs.

For his selfless efforts, people have been praising him on Twitter.

https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/what-is-pool-testing-and-how-this-could-help-india-increase-the-number-of-covid-19-tests-510934.html,"The number of COVID-19 cases has crossed 11,000 in India and is rapidly rising over the past few weeks. While it is a big number, the number of COVID-19 cases in India is much lesser than most of the countries around the world, which has better medical infrastructure.

Though it is a good thing that the number of people who are testing positive for the deadly infection is very low there is an argument that it is because we aren't testing enough. Since the outbreak began India has been only conducting COVID-19 tests on those who had returned from abroad and those who had come in contact with patients tested positive.

AFP

This has since changed and the scope of those who can be tested for COVID-19 has been widened. As of April 14, a total of 2,44,893 samples from 2,29,426 individuals were tested in India. The US and Italy, countries that have among the highest reported cases, have conducted 13 times and about five times as many tests as India has. India‚Äôs tests come to 161 tests per million population fewer than the 8,625 tests per million In the US and 17,333 in Italy.



Now with the number of cases spiking and the fear of community spread in some areas the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday laid down the roadmap for pool testing that may be conducted in less-affected areas of the country. The process of pool testing involves putting five swab samples together and testing them using a single reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test.

AFP

Sounding a note of urgency, the apex health research body said the number of COVID-19 cases in India is rising exponentially and in view of this, it is critical to increasing the numbers of tests conducted by laboratories. It said sample pooling for real-time RT-PCR screening for coronavirus is only recommended in areas with a low prevalence of COVID-19.

""Positivity rate in cases is still low. Hence, it may help to use the pooled samples for screening. A pooled testing algorithm involves the PCR screening of a specimen pool comprising multiple individual patient specimens, followed by individual testing only if a pool screens positive,‚Äù the advisory said.

AFP

""As all individual samples in a negative pool are regarded as negative, it results in substantial cost savings when a large proportion of pools tests negative,"" it said while strongly discouraging pooling of more than five samples, except in research mode. The objective is to increase the capacity of the laboratories to screen increased numbers of samples using molecular testing for COVID-19 for the purpose of surveillance, the ICMR said.

It said a feasibility study was conducted at DHR/ICMR Virus Research and Diagnostic Laboratory (VRDL) at King George's Medical University (KGMU) in Lucknow, where it has been demonstrated that ""performing real-time PCR for COVID-19 by pooling five samples of TS/NS (200 ul/sample) is feasible when the prevalence rates of infection are low"".

AFP

According to the advisory, all individual samples in a negative pool should be regarded as negative. ""Deconvoluted testing is recommended if any of the pools is positive. Pooling of more than five samples is not recommended to avoid the effect of dilution leading to false negatives,"" the advisory said. ""The sample pooling for real-time RT-PCR screening for COVID-19 is only recommended in areas with low prevalence of COVID-19 (initially using a proxy of low positivity of 5 pc for COVID-19,"" the ICMR stressed.

""Preferable number of samples to be pooled is five, though more than two samples can be pooled, but considering higher possibility of missing positive samples with low viral load, it strongly discouraged to pool more than five samples, except in research mode,"" the advisory said.

AFP

With the rise in coronavirus infections in India, the ICMR has taken into account the need to expeditiously expand COVID-19 testing facilities in all parts of the country and has initiated a proactive search of potential laboratories that could be enabled for coronavirus testing, a senior official said. The ICMR has already invited applications from all government and private medical colleges for establishing COVID-19 testing facilities."
https://www.indiatimes.com/auto/current/as-china-car-sales-boom-after-covid-19-a-record-number-of-people-are-opting-for-electric-cars-510938.html,"As China reopens its automobile industry for the country‚Äôs market, prospective sales are looking positive with a new-found appeal for personal vehicles after the Coronavirus outbreak. Among these, many first time vehicle buyers are reportedly preferring to go green with an electric vehicle.

As per a new survey conducted by Ipsos, a marketing research firm, 41% of those new buyers have a preference for EVs. March sales across the country have also reflected the growing trend.

The China Passenger Car Association reported a dramatic rise in sales in the month of March as sales shot up from being 96% deficit to 40% deficit year-on-year. Out of these vehicles sold, about 47,000 were electric cars. These cars included all brand makers‚Äô seals, from Tesla to BYD, Nio and others, as all of them enjoyed record breaking sales in the month.

Other OEMs are still in the process of restarting their operations. To debut the Volkswagen ID family in China, SAIC Volkswagen plant in Changsha resumed operations last week and will produce VW ID electric cars.

Audi e-Tron will also be locally produced in the country later this year. Tesla is targeting a local production of long range Model 3. M-Byte, Byton‚Äòs first mass production model, is also expected to be launched this year.

In order to help with the sales of such vehicles, the Chinese government is also taking several measures. It is extending EV subsidies, loosening restrictions as well as deploying a program similar to cash-for-clunkers in some areas.

As the Coronavirus-induced lockdown ends in other parts of the world, such a boom in the automobile industry is expected as people will now tend to prefer travelling by their own vehicle soon. And with the electric vehicles being the need of the hour to save planet Earth, it won‚Äôt be difficult for the car owners to buy.

https://www.indiatimes.com/technology/science-and-future/not-hospitals-home-treatments-can-be-key-to-beating-coronavirus-spread-510920.html,"Health care systems across the globe are struggling to cope up with the wave of COVID-19 patients caused by the Coronavirus pandemic. No other country has seen the devastation caused in the wake of the Coronavirus disease as much as Italy.

Learning from the experience, doctors in the country believe that the long established health care system has failed in the situation and needs a drastic revamp, one where patients are treated at home instead of hospitals.

Reuters

Almost a dozen physicians in Italy have appealed to their counterparts in other countries to take the health care to the communities instead of limiting the treatment to established hospitals. The suggestion stems from a study published by Mirco Nacoti, Luca Longhi, and their colleagues at Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital in Bergamo, Italy.



The Monumental Task

A humongous challenge for the health care officials at this point is to manage the available medical resources optimally to save as much lives as possible. Doctors have had to choose between patients to save at hospitals, citing limited number of critical life saving equipment like ventilators.

A similar condition is observed at the Papa Giovanni XXIII Hospital, a new state-of-the-art facility which is staggered under the COVID-19 caseload. ‚ÄúOur own hospital is highly contaminated, and we are far beyond the tipping point: 300 beds out of 900 are occupied by COVID-19 patients. Fully 70% of ICU beds in our hospital are reserved for critically ill COVID-19 patients with a reasonable chance to survive,‚Äù the paper written by the team of physicians mentions.

(Representative Image: Reuters)

It further adds, ‚Äúthe situation here is dismal as we operate well below our normal standard of care. Wait times for an intensive care bed are hours long. Older patients are not being resuscitated and die alone without appropriate palliative care, while the family is notified over the phone, often by a well-intentioned, exhausted, and emotionally depleted physician with no prior contact.‚Äù



With the overburdened medical resources, even regular medical services like pregnancy care and child delivery have been affected like never before as hospitals near collapse. The paper paints a grim picture of the reality in Italy.

Another big challenge is that the novel Coronavirus disease might be spreading in hospitals from patient to patient. Reports of the disease being spread among the occupants of a hospital are coming to light and in such a case, hospitals can be considered as a hotspot and a possible source of transmission to the healthy, in the worst-case, to the health workers.

The Key Learnings

The physicians urge their counterparts in the US to learn from Italy‚Äôs condition and adapt an invariably different approach to treating patients with Coronavirus. They suggest the medical forces in the US to decentralise the health care system needs and focus on community interventions instead.

That might mean a home centred care for Coronavirus patients i.e. something like doctor house calls. The practice can possibly reduce the community spread of the disease by reducing the exposure of the COVID-19 patient to the outside world.

(Representative Image: Reuters)

Interestingly, doctors mention that the treatment of COVID-19 at home is very much possible as no special medical equipment is required in most of the cases. Optimum nutrition through diet, steady breathing and Oxygen provision in case the patient has breathing difficulties is all that is required for most of the cases.



In bringing these remedial measures to the patient, a whole lot of chances of transmission of the disease can be avoided. In addition, such patients will not burden the already overburdened hospitals any further.

For patients that need more intensive care, dedicated Coronavirus medical centers should be used to deliver care.

The paper provides a thorough insight on the ground reality and how a key aspect in the equation can be modified to our benefit. With COVID-19 dedicated centres being set up in various hotspots around the globe, the idea might already have been brought to practice and should yield its results soon."
https://www.indiatimes.com/technology/science-and-future/rats-may-turn-to-cannibalism-in-coronavirus-lockdown-and-become-more-aggressive-510884.html,"The ongoing Coronavirus pandemic has impacted life on Earth in almost every way possible and a new school of thought now focuses on its effect on rats living across the globe.

To sum up, experts now suggest that a smarter, more aggressive breed of rats might emerge out of the COVID-19 pandemic all over the world.

(Representative Image: Reuters)

The thought stems from the places infested with rats. Since rats usually nest around the garbage dumpsters of restaurants, their shutdown due to the Coronavirus pandemic has left the rats with no food from their regular source.



Multiple experts now suggest that the resulting breed of rats might turn to cannibalism and infanticide to survive. They might also now move in hordes in search of new sources of food and chances are the resulting breed that makes it through will be smarter, more aggressive than their ancestors.



As Bobby Corrigan, an urban rodentologist, explains in an interview with NBC News, ""A restaurant all of a sudden closes now, which has happened by the thousands in not just New York City but coast to coast and around the world, and those rats that were living by that restaurant, some place nearby, and perhaps for decades having generations of rats that depended on that restaurant food ‚Äî well, life is no longer working for them, and they only have a couple of choices.""

He also mentions the choices to be grim - including cannibalism, rat battles and infanticide. So the smarter and fiercer rats that survive could be giving birth to a smarter, fiercer breed than before within their 23-day pregnancy period.

(Representative Image: Reuters)

A worst case scenario might involve these rats being infected with hantavirus or such infections, but cases of human infections are so rare that we don't have to worry about that front just yet. But a fiercer, more aggressive rat species emerging out of the Coronavirus pandemic is definitely something that can be a cause for local and community nuisance.



A learning shared by the experts from this is to ramp up the pest and rodent control measures in residential areas as well as business complexes to curb the growth of rat colonies."
