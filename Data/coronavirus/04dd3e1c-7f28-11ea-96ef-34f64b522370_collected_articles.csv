Under convalescent plasma technique or therapy, plasma of cured patients who have developed antibodies against Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus is used for coronavirus infection treatment.

The same treatment has been previously used to beat other pandemics such as SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and measles.

The antibodies from a recovered patient helped the immune system of an ailing person to combat the virus.

Officials, part of the meeting held through video conferencing, said L-G also issued directions for strictly compliance for standard operating procedure (SOP) and guidelines to avoid overcrowding in the hospitals.

The secretary of health department informed the attendees that personal protective equipment (PPEs) in sufficient number are being procured.

“The government has ordered for 1.5 lakh PPE kits and secured supply of 3,500 PPEs per day. Tender has also been finalised for another two lakh kits. An order has also been placed for five lakh N95 masks. The government is receiving 25,000 masks per week for frontline health workers or health professionals. The department is providing these PPEs to all COVID hospitals as per their requirement,” said an official, privy to the meeting.

He said that Baijal had directed health department to focus on precautionary measures for health care professionals, provide required PPEs, self-care, and training to ensure their safety and security."

Express News Service

Ever wondered why some COVID-19 tests require nose or mouth swabs while others use blood samples? Here's a handy guide on how COVID-19 testing works.

What is the most common test for COVID-19?

The most common test for COVID-19 is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)—a very sensitive test that looks for the RNA of the virus in a sample. This can detect as little as one virus particle in swabs taken from inside the mouth or nose. At the start of the outbreak, most countries relied on RT-PCR tests which take a minimum of five hours to show results.

Is there any other method through which COVID-19 can be confirmed in a person? If yes, which states in India are doing that?

Presence of COVID-19 can be confirmed through rapid diagnostic serological kits which use blood samples for the tests. The most common type of rapid diagnostic test marketed for COVID-19 includes a test that detects the presence of antibodies in the blood of people believed to have been infected with COVID-19. Antibodies are produced over days to weeks after infection with the virus.

Another type of rapid diagnostic test detects the presence of viral proteins (antigens) expressed by the COVID-19 virus in a sample from the respiratory tract of a person. The antigens detected are expressed only when the virus is actively replicating; therefore, such tests are best used to identify acute or early infection.

The rapid kits can give the results within 25-30 minutes. ICMR has permitted the test in India but it has not started as rapid diagnostic tests are yet to be delivered by suppliers.

What is RT-PCR pool testing and which states are doing this?

Meant to save the number of kits used, a pooled testing algorithm involves the PCR screening of a specimen pool comprising multiple individual patient specimens, followed by individual testing only if a pool screens positive. As all individual samples in a negative pool are regarded as negative, it results in substantial cost savings when a large proportion of pools tests need to be tested.

A feasibility study was conducted at ICMR’s Virus Research & Diagnostic Laboratory at King George's Medical University, Lucknow, and it was demonstrated that performing real-time PCR for COVID-19 by pooling 5 samples is feasible when the prevalence rates of infection are low.

Andaman and Nicobar islands was the first region in India to start pool testing for COVID-19 and now the most populous state Uttar Pradesh too has started it.

What are the limitations of RT-PCR tests?

RT-PCR is very specific and sensitive. However, once a patient has recovered, the virus is eliminated and this test can no longer tell if they had been infected. This creates significant uncertainty especially if someone has self-isolated due to mild and unclear symptoms.

Also, even if the RT-PCR test itself only takes several hours, it can take days before the result is known due to sample transport and processing.

However, current antibody tests for the novel coronavirus haven’t fully been tested yet to make sure they are reliable, which is why the WHO recommends the RT PCR test.

What is door to door screening and which states are doing this?

All cities and districts where COVID-19 cases have been detected are required to send teams of healthcare workers to every household for health surveys in areas ranging from 3 km, 5 km and 10 km radius (depending on the number of cases) or in the whole area identified under the cluster containment strategy.

The teams ask people whether anyone has a history of international travel or is suffering from any influenza like illnesses. If people with symptoms are identified, they can be further assessed and tested for COVID-19.

It has been implemented in all states where COVID-19 cases have been detected. As of now, there are 377 districts where COVID-19 cases have been identified."

WASHINGTON: There is more scope for more ""urgent"" policy actions in India as the economic toll from the coronavirus pandemic is likely to be ""large"", a top IMF official said, noting that the fiscal stimulus package unveiled by the government to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 is a step in the right direction.

In an interview to PTI, Vitor Gaspar, Director of Fiscal Affairs Department of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said the balance of risks is tilted to the downside, given the uncertainty surrounding the pandemic that has halted economic activities across the world.

""India has limited fiscal space, but also a need to support the health and economic wellbeing of its citizens.

In the current exceptional circumstances, the need for policy action is urgent,"" Gasper said when asked about India's fiscal strength and the impact of the COVID-19 on its economy.

""The economic toll from the pandemic is likely to be large. We estimate that growth in the fiscal year 2020/21 will be reduced to 1.9 per cent, reflecting both the domestic COVID-19 impact from the unprecedented national lockdown and weak external demand,"" he said.

In the face of the pandemic, which is likely to have devastating human and economic consequences, there is an urgent need for government action, including prioritising spending on health care, providing income support to those most vulnerable, and supporting micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), he said.

""The measures taken to date - such as the provision of food and cooking gas to vulnerable households, as well as cash transfers to poorer households - go in the right direction and are a good start,"" Gasper said.

The Finance Ministry unveiled a Rs 1.70 lakh crore economic package on March 26 involving free foodgrain and cooking gas for the poor for the next three months.

The total number of COVID-19 cases in India has risen to 11,439 on Wednesday while the death toll stands at 377.

""To be candid, we see scope for additional spending in these areas, beyond what has already been announced, as well as a need to enact policies which support MSMEs who have been hit by the (appropriate) social distancing measures and nationwide lockdown,"" he added.

According to Gasper, in India, large, timely and targeted fiscal and financial sector measures are essential to shield vulnerable households and firms.

""The fiscal stimulus package is one step in the right direction. The package has appropriately included in-kind (food; cooking gas) and cash transfers to lower-income households; insurance coverage for workers in the healthcare sector; and wage support to low-wage workers,"" he said.

""Similarly, a three-month moratorium was allowed for all term loans for banks and nonbank financial companies, as well as interest deferral for working capital loans,"" he said.

When asked about the specific measure India could take to save the economy, he said the IMF believes measures could be taken on fiscal, monetary and financial sector policies in the near term.

On fiscal policy, additional support is needed in the near term, including on health care and for small and medium-sized firms and vulnerable households, beyond the fiscal stimulus measures already announced, he said.

Over the medium term, though, substantial new measures will be needed to bring the deficit and debt back towards the central government's medium-term targets (deficit of three per cent and debt of 40 per cent as a share of GDP), he added.

Monetary policy, he asserted, should maintain a strong easing bias to mitigate any sharp COVID-19-related slowdown and support the recovery, given the sharp slowdown in domestic and global activities, moderating inflation amid a wide negative output gap, and lower commodity prices.

Gasper said financial sector stress prior to COVID-19 constrained monetary transmission needs to be closely monitored.

Despite measures to improve liquidity conditions, including through temporary and partial guarantees, funding pressures persist, with implications for the recovery once the shock dissipates.

""Exchange rate flexibility should continue to play the role of a shock absorber, while avoiding excessive volatilities,"" he said.

Experience from the COVID-19 pandemic shows that monitoring and containment costs are much lower than those of mitigation and treatment, he noted.

As such, it is very important to prevent the health systems from becoming overloaded.

National governments should continue to allocate sufficient funds for subnational governments to spend on health services or mobilise medical resources, Gasper said.

He said based on the experience from other countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, India's proactive decision to pursue the nationwide lockdown for three weeks is an important step to contain the disease and save lives.

Stating that the support for health systems, including higher spending is needed, the IMF official noted that it is crucial to prioritise health spending for medical equipment and COVID testing; compensate doctors and nurses appropriately; and make sure that hospitals and makeshift clinics have enough personal protective equipment and resources to function effectively.

Emergency lifelines should be targeted to households to maintain basic needs and viable firms to prevent layoffs and exits from supply chains.

They should be made progressive to ensure that lower-income households benefit more.

They should be cost-effective and embedded in medium-term budget frameworks, Gasper added."

NEW DELHI: Billionaire Gautam Adani on Wednesday exuded confidence that the Indian economy would bounce back from the downturn caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, saying it might take time but it is possible.

International agencies from the World Bank to IMF have projected that the Indian economy will grow at its slowest pace since the 1991 economic reforms. ""Global economic history is full of major ups and downs. India's domestic economy has always stood as a great shield in protecting the country from global economic headwinds. I have no doubts that the nation will be able to rise above this crisis. It might take time but there is ample optimism to show that it is possible,"" he wrote in a blog on Linkedin.

The outbreak of pandemic has led to the government imposing a nationwide lockdown that has shut factories and businesses, suspended rail and air travel and restricted movement of people and goods. The result is a severe disruption in the economy.

While the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected economic growth of 1.9 per cent in 2020-21, the World Bank sees India's growth at 1.5- 2.8 per cent as the coronavirus outbreak severely disrupts the economy.

The Asian Development Bank sees India's GDP growth slipping to 4 per cent in the current fiscal, while S&P Global Ratings has further slashed its economic growth forecast for the country to 3.5 per cent from a previous downgrade of 5.2 per cent.

Fitch Ratings puts its estimate for India's growth at 2 per cent in FY21, while Moody's Investors Service has slashed its estimate of India's GDP growth during 2020 calendar year to 2.5 per cent, from an earlier estimate of 5.3 per cent. ""However alarming the post-Coronavirus world might seem to appear, it does not pull me down. Instead, by looking around I get great hope and confidence to bounce back,"" Adani wrote in the blog titled 'How COVID-19 helped rediscover hope and goodness'.

The coronavirus, he said, can restrict movement but it cannot contain the urge to fight and help each other. ""It cannot stop us from being positive about the future. Together, let us stay resilient and hopeful,"" he said.

Adani, who heads the port-to-energy conglomerate Adani Group , said rising global concern on the vast implications of the COVID-19 outbreak on future is obvious with anxieties mounting on economies, jobs and the very existence of mankind. ""However, amidst the gloom, there are several small discoveries that are worth cherishing,"" he said as he went on to cite new discoveries that have brought a ray of hope.

He cited MyLab Discovery Solutions, a small startup in Pune, becoming the first Indian firm to produce indigenous coronovirus testing kits. ""What is even more inspiring is the story of Minal Dakhave Bhonsale, the virologist who headed this project,"" he said adding she managed to deliver the project amid an advanced stage of pregnancy.

The project was completed a day before she delivered a baby girl. ""Hundreds of such incredible stories that demonstrate resilience, hope, and power of the human spirit are unfolding around us every day,"" he said.

Continuing to cite examples of innovation, he said a team of engineers at Adani Port in Vizag created a sanitized water shower in just about 4 hours. ""Difficult times bring us closer and make us stronger to face any eventuality. We must be able to look around ourselves and find these narratives,"" he said.

Stating that he had come across several inspiring narratives on social media, he said several families from different sections of the society have invested their lockdown time in aggregating essentials for the underprivileged.

These are common people leading humble lives but what makes them extraordinary is their intent to care for others. ""Domestic helps, daily wage earners and scores of people who earn their living by doing odd-jobs are being looked after, not just by governments, large corporations or charitable organisations, but by common people living around them. There are also virtual groups of animal lovers who are feeding strays and ensuring that they find safe shelter,"" he wrote.

Similarly, a civil service aspirant, Naveen MS in Chitradurga district of Karnataka took up the responsibility of creating awareness and dispelling myths on coronavirus among rural communities.

""What was most admirable was his vision. He thought that for the economy to resurrect it was essential that people's minds stay healthy. In fact, I feel gratified to see the community outreach work being delivered by young volunteers at the Adani Foundation. Over the past three weeks, millions settled in the remote corners of the country have been touched and empowered to stay safe against the COVID19 outbreak,"" he said.

He said that this collective goodness and love for each other hadn't erupted suddenly but it was always there within. ""The COVID19 crisis has only presented an opportunity for us to reflect upon this feeling of compassion and worked as a trigger to unite people,"" he added."

WASHINGTON: American actor Rita Wilson and her husband Tom Hanks were the first celebrities to reveal they tested positive for the coronavirus last month. Now, Wilson has opened up in greater detail about the couple's symptoms and their experience with the controversial drug chloroquine.

According to Fox News, 60-year-old singer Wilson conducted her first interview post-coronavirus on Tuesday morning's episode of CBS' ""The Talk"" with Gayle King.

The 'Hip Hop Hooray' songstress shared exactly how she was feeling as she and her 60-year-old husband Hanks battled the novel virus in quarantine in Australia.

Wilson detailed her symptoms to King, ""I was very tired. I felt extremely achy. Uncomfortable, didn't want to be touched and then the fever started. Chills like I've never had before. Looking back, I realise I was also losing my sense of taste and smell which I didn't realise at the time.""

Wilson shared her fever reached its highest temperature about nine days following her positive test results. ""I think it got close to 102,"" she said.

The 'Let Me Be' singer revealed that she was given chloroquine, a drug that has been used to prevent and treat malaria that is being studied as a possible coronavirus treatment.

Wilson shared that her fever subsided after taking the medicine, but she's not sure if it's the reason it went away. She explained, ""I can only tell you that I don't know if the drug worked or if it was just time for my fever to break, but my fever did break. But the chloroquine had extreme side effects.""

The 'Angel of Morning' songstress shared that after being treated with chloroquine, she felt ""completely nauseous"" and suffered from vertigo.

She said that she couldn't walk and her muscles felt very weak. The star added, ""I think people have to be very considerate about that drug. We don't really know if it's helpful in this case.""

She admitted that her husband, Hanks experienced ""milder symptoms,"" and ""He didn't have as high of a fever. He did not lose his sense of taste or smell, but it still took us the same time to get through it.""

The pair reportedly spent five days in a Queensland, Australia, hospital before remaining in isolation for weeks. Following their recovery, the duo was spotted for the first time at their Los Angeles home in late March.

Wilson confirmed that while she and Hanks still do not know for sure where or from whom they contracted the virus, they've learned they were both exposed to it ""at the same time.""

The 'New Girl' songstress and Hanks were in Australia when their tests for the novel virus came back positive.

The 'Forrest Gump' star Hanks had been in the land down under filming an upcoming Elvis biopic before director Baz Luhrmann suspended filming.

""All I can say is all of our close contacts, family, our work team, no one has tested positive,"" Wilson added."

NEW DELHI: Forced out of grounds, tracks and courts by the COVID-19 pandemic, sports events may help in the long run, but medical experts on Wednesday warned that resuming anything this year could mean putting lives at risk.

When sporting events do eventually make a comeback, which some of the region's top doctors believe is not going to happen until at least the next six months or may be nine, it may not be the same initially.

From cricket, football, tennis, racing, to the mother of all sporting events, the Olympics, the novel coronavirus has not spared anything.

""I have no doubt that sport is great but at the moment, the focus is on saving lives, and having sports events, which attract large crowds, could prove to be disastrous,"" Akash Sabharwal, a renowned sports injury surgeon associated with the Max Hospitals, told PTI.

Since the ""transmission rate is very high"", he said it should be completely avoided for a substantial period of time, even though sport encourages physical and mental well-being besides a sense of inclusivity.

As chief executives of various leagues and administrators mull ways to restart tournaments and championships once the pandemic is brought under control, the doctor said even hosting them without an audience is not advisable at this point of time.

""That can be done when things are much better from what they are now. But even then, it will be risky as it involves players, officials, organisers and so many staff, and chances of getting infected will always be there,"" he added.

""I understand big money is involved in events like the IPL, but even the Olympics have been postponed, because there is no other option.""

The BCCI on Tuesday told Indian Premier League franchises that the event stands ""postponed indefinitely"" after the lockdown to combat the pandemic was extended till May 3, leaving no scope for the league to take place during its designated window.

Dr Ashis Acharya, a sports medicine expert at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, one of the capital's top health institutes, went a step further and said live games should not be held for at least six months.

""Sports is way down in the priority right now. We have to first focus on the essentials so that people are not strained. I don't think it is wise to have them for at least the next three to six months,"" Acharya said.

Dr Neha Gupta, an infectious disease specialist at Gurugram's Medanta Hospital, concurred with Sabharwal and Acharya.

""We have seen that with this new virus, the chances of spread is very high, so I don't think sports events should be held for some months, at least till the time the situation is not brought under control,"" Gupta said.

No different was the thinking of Dr Puneet Khanna, the head of respiratory medicine department at the Manipal Hospital in Dwarka.

""It's absolutely wise to not host any sporting events for three to six months at least, and doing otherwise could prove to be a disaster, putting lives in danger,"" he said.

""At best, they can be held without audience with most of the people catching the action on television. And that after the situation improves from what it is is now.""

India currently has over 11,500 positive cases with more than 350 recorded deaths, making it virtually impossible for the government to lift any of the restrictions put in place last month.

Across the world, the pandemic, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan in Hubei province, has claimed more than 1.2 lakh lives, while infecting over 20 lakh people.

All sporting events, big and small, have been either cancelled or postponed in the wake of the unprecedented global health crisis, with the biggest of them being the postponement of the Tokyo Olympics by a year."
