A BSF driver accompanying Centre‚Äôs Inter-Ministerial Central Team (ICMT) to West Bengal has tested positive for COVID-19. Following the development, 50 personnel from BSF‚Äôs Kolkata headquarters have been quarantined as the driver belonged to the force.

Two IMCTs had been sent by the Centre to West Bengal to monitor Covid-19 containment measures and lockdown implementation in the state and and send a report to the Centre.

Since the IMCTs initially did not get adequate cooperation from the state, they stayed at BSF guesthouse and used BSF vehicles . Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT as they moved around to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. This IMCT is headed by Apurva Chandra, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence.

The two IMCTs sent to West Bengal have given an unflattering report of the situation in the state and even said that the mortality rate among Covid-19 patients (12.8 per cent) is the highest in the state. The IMCT is now back in Delhi.

In contrast, the home ministry has claimed that the IMCTs sent to Gujarat have praised the efforts of the state government in fighting COVID-19. Ahmedabad and Surat are among the most severely affected cities in the state. It is not yet clear whether the MHA has asked the West Bengal IMCT members to go for testing or quarantine.

A BSF officer from Bengal said, ‚ÄúAlthough this driver was not in direct contact with the IMCT members and all drivers had been directed to stay put in their vehicles when the IMCT was out doing its work, we are tracing all contacts and taking necessary precautions.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the BSF Headquarters in Delhi have been sealed after a constable working in the office of an Additional DG-rank officer tested positive late Sunday night. The headquarters are being sanitised currently. Sources said the ADG is likely to be asked to go for testing.

This comes in the backdrop of 56 BSF personnel having tested positive so far. As many as 32 of these are suspected to have got the infection while discharging law and order duties with Delhi Police in Jama Masjid and Chandni Mahal areas.

Meanwhile, 15 personnel of the Sashatra Seema Bal, which guards the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border, have also tested positive in Delhi. They all belong to one battalion stationed at Ghitorni.

‚ÄúA head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on 3rd May 2020. He last attended office on Friday 1st May 2020. He was working in an office on the second floor of BSF Force Headquarters. All persons who came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution, ‚Äù a statement from the BSF said about latest developments.

It was only on Friday that BSF the had got its entire headquarter disinfected. ‚ÄúThe disinfection of complete Block 10 CGO complex BSF force headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today light of latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, ‚Äù BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bharadwaj said.

The developments come days after 135 CRPF personnel having tested positive at its Mayur Vihar camp.

Written by Saikat Sinha Roy and M Suresh Babu

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

(AP/File) Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. (AP/File)

US officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press.

READ | Coronavirus not ‚Äòmanmade or genetically modified‚Äô: US intelligence agencies

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

Not classified but marked ?for official use only, the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data, the analysis states.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus was a contagion for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad ? and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China‚Äôs changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report. China informed the WHO of the outbreak on Dec. 31. It contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on January 8.

Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government‚Äôs missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information, and officials hesitant to report bad news.

There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world‚Äôs medical supplies.

In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame US intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the US, Trump wrote without citing specifics.

Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.

Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible mistake. His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC‚Äôs This Week, Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we‚Äôve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab, Pompeo said.

And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

Experts say the virus arose naturally in bats, and make it clear that they believe it wasn‚Äôt man-made. Many virologists say the chance that the outbreak was caused by a lab accident is very low, though scientists are still working to determine a point at which it may have jumped from animals to humans.

Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on US accusations that the outbreak was China‚Äôs fault, pointing to many missteps made by American officials in their own fight against the outbreak.

China‚Äôs public announcement on Jan. 20 that the virus was transmissible from person to person left the US nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic, during which the US government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits.

The US government has ignored the facts, diverted public attention and engaged in buck-passing in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for incompetence in the fight against the epidemic, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday.

With the help of science, humanity will eventually overcome the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Many theories and philosophies will emerge. Many interpretations will be presented before the people and the governments. But the question is whether the post-COVID 19 world will be the same as before or will it change, whether the capitalist order will become more inhuman and exploitative. Thomas L Friedman has written that ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is a black elephant. It is the logical outcome of our increasingly destructive wars against nature‚Äù. The emerging situation is likely to be a matter of much public debate in which Karl Marx and Marxism will occupy centerstage.

‚ÄúAll philosophers have interpreted the world in various ways. However, the point is to change it‚Äù Marx wrote in Thesis on Feuerbach. This was the fundamental premise of the philosophical pursuit of Marx and his lifelong companion Friedrich Engels. They analysed human existence, the relationship between human beings and nature and the ways in which production and the reproduction of the human species and the economy take place.

While asserting that ‚Äúlabour is the source of wealth and prime basic condition for human existence,‚Äù Marx and Engels analysed the dialectics of nature. They pointed out how the harmony among people, land, water and air leads to changes. In Capital, Marx explained that ‚Äúlabour is in the first place a process in which both man and nature participate‚Äù. Marx went on to explain that labour process was nothing but the production process. He showed how labour is the source of wealth and how labour power keeps producing surplus value. In the same work, he explained how under capitalism, surplus value is appropriated by capitalists, who are the owners of the means of production. He also explained how this appropriation of surplus value leads to accumulation of wealth at one pole and the pauperisation of the working people at another. Such inequality is reflected in the miserable working and living conditions of the working people.

While analysing the housing question of the society, especially how the bourgeoisie solves the housing question, Engels pointed out ‚Äúthe poor districts in which the workers are crowded together are the breeding places of all those epidemics which from time to time afflict out towns. Cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, smallpox and other ravaging diseases spared their germs in the pestilential air and the poisoned water of these working class quarters‚Äù. This explains why the poor and the migrant workers of all countries including India are facing unimaginable difficulties and becoming victims of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The developments in the past two decades have forced the capitalists to think of new deals and plans to perpetuate the exploitation of the working classes. Before COVID-19, the world capitalist economy faced a crisis in 2008, when the US economy was confronted with a subprime loan crisis. The current pandemic has pushed the world economic order on to a ventilator.

There are many who think that this pandemic is affecting all countries, all communities and all classes in the same way. Therefore, we should first allow the governments to handle it and then fight for our concerns. But that is not right. Capitalists are more clever. In the name of fighting the pandemic, capitalist governments are taking more control in their hands.

In India, the BJP-RSS combine is trying to push the country towards a theocratic fascist state. Left and secular democratic forces have intensified efforts to channelise the anger of the working people against this capitalist and fascist political order, which has put the lives of millions of common people at stake by denying them their rights.

The lies and failures of the government have to be exposed. Capitalism uses religion as a tool to make people fight each other but the millions of people will understand the heinous design of communal-fascist rulers, and not allow them to divide society further. When Marx looked at the Indian social structure, he understood the place of caste in it. His writings after the Taiping Rebellion in China, Sepoy Mutiny in India (India‚Äôs first war of independence) and Black Resistance in America made him talk about the urgent need of a democratic revolution in India. Marx‚Äôs term ‚Äúdemocratic revolution‚Äù holds possibilities for the abolition of the caste system.

In the philosophical pursuit for a new world, Marxism emerged as a revolutionary theory and science. The three integral components of Marxism, as Lenin pointed, out are one, the philosophy of dialectical materialism (historical materialism), two, the theory of surplus value and three, the doctrine of class struggle as the motive force of History.

The future is going to witness intense class struggles for political power so that a new social order emerges in which the state shall ensure housing, healthcare, education and all means of livelihood to all its citizens, and equality, justice and dignity of all citizens are upheld.

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Karl Marx on May 5 (1818) while paying tributes let the working people advance their struggle to overthrow the capitalist society and to liberate from the chains of oppression and exploitation.

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development.

Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the US, Trump wrote without citing specifics.

Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.

Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible mistake. His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC‚Äôs This Week, Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we‚Äôve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab, Pompeo said.

And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

Experts say the virus arose naturally in bats, and make it clear that they believe it wasn‚Äôt man-made. Many virologists say the chance that the outbreak was caused by a lab accident is very low, though scientists are still working to determine a point at which it may have jumped from animals to humans.

Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on US accusations that the outbreak was China‚Äôs fault, pointing to many missteps made by American officials in their own fight against the outbreak.

China‚Äôs public announcement on Jan. 20 that the virus was transmissible from person to person left the US nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic, during which the US government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits.

The US government has ignored the facts, diverted public attention and engaged in buck-passing in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for incompetence in the fight against the epidemic, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday.

With the help of science, humanity will eventually overcome the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Many theories and philosophies will emerge. Many interpretations will be presented before the people and the governments. But the question is whether the post-COVID 19 world will be the same as before or will it change, whether the capitalist order will become more inhuman and exploitative. Thomas L Friedman has written that ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is a black elephant. It is the logical outcome of our increasingly destructive wars against nature‚Äù. The emerging situation is likely to be a matter of much public debate in which Karl Marx and Marxism will occupy centerstage.

‚ÄúAll philosophers have interpreted the world in various ways. However, the point is to change it‚Äù Marx wrote in Thesis on Feuerbach. This was the fundamental premise of the philosophical pursuit of Marx and his lifelong companion Friedrich Engels. They analysed human existence, the relationship between human beings and nature and the ways in which production and the reproduction of the human species and the economy take place.

While asserting that ‚Äúlabour is the source of wealth and prime basic condition for human existence,‚Äù Marx and Engels analysed the dialectics of nature. They pointed out how the harmony among people, land, water and air leads to changes. In Capital, Marx explained that ‚Äúlabour is in the first place a process in which both man and nature participate‚Äù. Marx went on to explain that labour process was nothing but the production process. He showed how labour is the source of wealth and how labour power keeps producing surplus value. In the same work, he explained how under capitalism, surplus value is appropriated by capitalists, who are the owners of the means of production. He also explained how this appropriation of surplus value leads to accumulation of wealth at one pole and the pauperisation of the working people at another. Such inequality is reflected in the miserable working and living conditions of the working people.

While analysing the housing question of the society, especially how the bourgeoisie solves the housing question, Engels pointed out ‚Äúthe poor districts in which the workers are crowded together are the breeding places of all those epidemics which from time to time afflict out towns. Cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, smallpox and other ravaging diseases spared their germs in the pestilential air and the poisoned water of these working class quarters‚Äù. This explains why the poor and the migrant workers of all countries including India are facing unimaginable difficulties and becoming victims of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The developments in the past two decades have forced the capitalists to think of new deals and plans to perpetuate the exploitation of the working classes. Before COVID-19, the world capitalist economy faced a crisis in 2008, when the US economy was confronted with a subprime loan crisis. The current pandemic has pushed the world economic order on to a ventilator.

There are many who think that this pandemic is affecting all countries, all communities and all classes in the same way. Therefore, we should first allow the governments to handle it and then fight for our concerns. But that is not right. Capitalists are more clever. In the name of fighting the pandemic, capitalist governments are taking more control in their hands.

In India, the BJP-RSS combine is trying to push the country towards a theocratic fascist state. Left and secular democratic forces have intensified efforts to channelise the anger of the working people against this capitalist and fascist political order, which has put the lives of millions of common people at stake by denying them their rights.

The lies and failures of the government have to be exposed. Capitalism uses religion as a tool to make people fight each other but the millions of people will understand the heinous design of communal-fascist rulers, and not allow them to divide society further. When Marx looked at the Indian social structure, he understood the place of caste in it. His writings after the Taiping Rebellion in China, Sepoy Mutiny in India (India‚Äôs first war of independence) and Black Resistance in America made him talk about the urgent need of a democratic revolution in India. Marx‚Äôs term ‚Äúdemocratic revolution‚Äù holds possibilities for the abolition of the caste system.

In the philosophical pursuit for a new world, Marxism emerged as a revolutionary theory and science. The three integral components of Marxism, as Lenin pointed, out are one, the philosophy of dialectical materialism (historical materialism), two, the theory of surplus value and three, the doctrine of class struggle as the motive force of History.

The future is going to witness intense class struggles for political power so that a new social order emerges in which the state shall ensure housing, healthcare, education and all means of livelihood to all its citizens, and equality, justice and dignity of all citizens are upheld.

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Karl Marx on May 5 (1818) while paying tributes let the working people advance their struggle to overthrow the capitalist society and to liberate from the chains of oppression and exploitation.

A BSF driver accompanying Centre‚Äôs Inter-Ministerial Central Team (ICMT) to West Bengal has tested positive for COVID-19. Following the development, 50 personnel from BSF‚Äôs Kolkata headquarters have been quarantined as the driver belonged to the force.

Two IMCTs had been sent by the Centre to West Bengal to monitor Covid-19 containment measures and lockdown implementation in the state and and send a report to the Centre.

Since the IMCTs initially did not get adequate cooperation from the state, they stayed at BSF guesthouse and used BSF vehicles . Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT as they moved around to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. This IMCT is headed by Apurva Chandra, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence.

The two IMCTs sent to West Bengal have given an unflattering report of the situation in the state and even said that the mortality rate among Covid-19 patients (12.8 per cent) is the highest in the state. The IMCT is now back in Delhi.

In contrast, the home ministry has claimed that the IMCTs sent to Gujarat have praised the efforts of the state government in fighting COVID-19. Ahmedabad and Surat are among the most severely affected cities in the state. It is not yet clear whether the MHA has asked the West Bengal IMCT members to go for testing or quarantine.

A BSF officer from Bengal said, ‚ÄúAlthough this driver was not in direct contact with the IMCT members and all drivers had been directed to stay put in their vehicles when the IMCT was out doing its work, we are tracing all contacts and taking necessary precautions.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the BSF Headquarters in Delhi have been sealed after a constable working in the office of an Additional DG-rank officer tested positive late Sunday night. The headquarters are being sanitised currently. Sources said the ADG is likely to be asked to go for testing.

This comes in the backdrop of 56 BSF personnel having tested positive so far. As many as 32 of these are suspected to have got the infection while discharging law and order duties with Delhi Police in Jama Masjid and Chandni Mahal areas.

Meanwhile, 15 personnel of the Sashatra Seema Bal, which guards the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border, have also tested positive in Delhi. They all belong to one battalion stationed at Ghitorni.

‚ÄúA head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on 3rd May 2020. He last attended office on Friday 1st May 2020. He was working in an office on the second floor of BSF Force Headquarters. All persons who came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution, ‚Äù a statement from the BSF said about latest developments.

It was only on Friday that BSF the had got its entire headquarter disinfected. ‚ÄúThe disinfection of complete Block 10 CGO complex BSF force headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today light of latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, ‚Äù BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bharadwaj said.

The developments come days after 135 CRPF personnel having tested positive at its Mayur Vihar camp.

(Representational Image) The swift action of Kerala government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. (Representational Image)

Written by Saikat Sinha Roy and M Suresh Babu

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

(AP/File)

US officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press.

READ | Coronavirus not ‚Äòmanmade or genetically modified‚Äô: US intelligence agencies

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

Not classified but marked ?for official use only, the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data, the analysis states.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus was a contagion for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad ? and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China‚Äôs changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report. China informed the WHO of the outbreak on Dec. 31. It contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on January 8.

Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government‚Äôs missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information, and officials hesitant to report bad news.

There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world‚Äôs medical supplies.

In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame US intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.

But he added, Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we‚Äôve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab, Pompeo said.

And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

US officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press.

READ | Coronavirus not ‚Äòmanmade or genetically modified‚Äô: US intelligence agencies

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

Not classified but marked ?for official use only, the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data, the analysis states.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus was a contagion for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad ? and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China‚Äôs changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report. China informed the WHO of the outbreak on Dec. 31. It contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on January 8.

Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government‚Äôs missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information, and officials hesitant to report bad news.

There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world‚Äôs medical supplies.

In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame US intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the US, Trump wrote without citing specifics.

Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.

Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible mistake. His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC‚Äôs This Week, Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we‚Äôve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab, Pompeo said.

And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

Experts say the virus arose naturally in bats, and make it clear that they believe it wasn‚Äôt man-made. Many virologists say the chance that the outbreak was caused by a lab accident is very low, though scientists are still working to determine a point at which it may have jumped from animals to humans.

Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on US accusations that the outbreak was China‚Äôs fault, pointing to many missteps made by American officials in their own fight against the outbreak.

China‚Äôs public announcement on Jan. 20 that the virus was transmissible from person to person left the US nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic, during which the US government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits.

The US government has ignored the facts, diverted public attention and engaged in buck-passing in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for incompetence in the fight against the epidemic, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday.

With the help of science, humanity will eventually overcome the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Many theories and philosophies will emerge. Many interpretations will be presented before the people and the governments. But the question is whether the post-COVID 19 world will be the same as before or will it change, whether the capitalist order will become more inhuman and exploitative. Thomas L Friedman has written that ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is a black elephant. It is the logical outcome of our increasingly destructive wars against nature‚Äù. The emerging situation is likely to be a matter of much public debate in which Karl Marx and Marxism will occupy centerstage.

‚ÄúAll philosophers have interpreted the world in various ways. However, the point is to change it‚Äù Marx wrote in Thesis on Feuerbach. This was the fundamental premise of the philosophical pursuit of Marx and his lifelong companion Friedrich Engels. They analysed human existence, the relationship between human beings and nature and the ways in which production and the reproduction of the human species and the economy take place.

While asserting that ‚Äúlabour is the source of wealth and prime basic condition for human existence,‚Äù Marx and Engels analysed the dialectics of nature. They pointed out how the harmony among people, land, water and air leads to changes. In Capital, Marx explained that ‚Äúlabour is in the first place a process in which both man and nature participate‚Äù. Marx went on to explain that labour process was nothing but the production process. He showed how labour is the source of wealth and how labour power keeps producing surplus value. In the same work, he explained how under capitalism, surplus value is appropriated by capitalists, who are the owners of the means of production. He also explained how this appropriation of surplus value leads to accumulation of wealth at one pole and the pauperisation of the working people at another. Such inequality is reflected in the miserable working and living conditions of the working people.

While analysing the housing question of the society, especially how the bourgeoisie solves the housing question, Engels pointed out ‚Äúthe poor districts in which the workers are crowded together are the breeding places of all those epidemics which from time to time afflict out towns. Cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, smallpox and other ravaging diseases spared their germs in the pestilential air and the poisoned water of these working class quarters‚Äù. This explains why the poor and the migrant workers of all countries including India are facing unimaginable difficulties and becoming victims of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The developments in the past two decades have forced the capitalists to think of new deals and plans to perpetuate the exploitation of the working classes. Before COVID-19, the world capitalist economy faced a crisis in 2008, when the US economy was confronted with a subprime loan crisis. The current pandemic has pushed the world economic order on to a ventilator.

There are many who think that this pandemic is affecting all countries, all communities and all classes in the same way. Therefore, we should first allow the governments to handle it and then fight for our concerns. But that is not right. Capitalists are more clever. In the name of fighting the pandemic, capitalist governments are taking more control in their hands.

In India, the BJP-RSS combine is trying to push the country towards a theocratic fascist state. Left and secular democratic forces have intensified efforts to channelise the anger of the working people against this capitalist and fascist political order, which has put the lives of millions of common people at stake by denying them their rights.

The lies and failures of the government have to be exposed. Capitalism uses religion as a tool to make people fight each other but the millions of people will understand the heinous design of communal-fascist rulers, and not allow them to divide society further. When Marx looked at the Indian social structure, he understood the place of caste in it. His writings after the Taiping Rebellion in China, Sepoy Mutiny in India (India‚Äôs first war of independence) and Black Resistance in America made him talk about the urgent need of a democratic revolution in India. Marx‚Äôs term ‚Äúdemocratic revolution‚Äù holds possibilities for the abolition of the caste system.

In the philosophical pursuit for a new world, Marxism emerged as a revolutionary theory and science. The three integral components of Marxism, as Lenin pointed, out are one, the philosophy of dialectical materialism (historical materialism), two, the theory of surplus value and three, the doctrine of class struggle as the motive force of History.

The future is going to witness intense class struggles for political power so that a new social order emerges in which the state shall ensure housing, healthcare, education and all means of livelihood to all its citizens, and equality, justice and dignity of all citizens are upheld.

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Karl Marx on May 5 (1818) while paying tributes let the working people advance their struggle to overthrow the capitalist society and to liberate from the chains of oppression and exploitation.

(Express photo) Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT sent to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. (Express photo)

A BSF driver accompanying Centre‚Äôs Inter-Ministerial Central Team (ICMT) to West Bengal has tested positive for COVID-19. Following the development, 50 personnel from BSF‚Äôs Kolkata headquarters have been quarantined as the driver belonged to the force.

Two IMCTs had been sent by the Centre to West Bengal to monitor Covid-19 containment measures and lockdown implementation in the state and and send a report to the Centre.

Since the IMCTs initially did not get adequate cooperation from the state, they stayed at BSF guesthouse and used BSF vehicles . Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT as they moved around to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. This IMCT is headed by Apurva Chandra, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence.

The two IMCTs sent to West Bengal have given an unflattering report of the situation in the state and even said that the mortality rate among Covid-19 patients (12.8 per cent) is the highest in the state. The IMCT is now back in Delhi.

In contrast, the home ministry has claimed that the IMCTs sent to Gujarat have praised the efforts of the state government in fighting COVID-19. Ahmedabad and Surat are among the most severely affected cities in the state. It is not yet clear whether the MHA has asked the West Bengal IMCT members to go for testing or quarantine.

A BSF officer from Bengal said, ‚ÄúAlthough this driver was not in direct contact with the IMCT members and all drivers had been directed to stay put in their vehicles when the IMCT was out doing its work, we are tracing all contacts and taking necessary precautions.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the BSF Headquarters in Delhi have been sealed after a constable working in the office of an Additional DG-rank officer tested positive late Sunday night. The headquarters are being sanitised currently. Sources said the ADG is likely to be asked to go for testing.

This comes in the backdrop of 56 BSF personnel having tested positive so far. As many as 32 of these are suspected to have got the infection while discharging law and order duties with Delhi Police in Jama Masjid and Chandni Mahal areas.

Meanwhile, 15 personnel of the Sashatra Seema Bal, which guards the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border, have also tested positive in Delhi. They all belong to one battalion stationed at Ghitorni.

‚ÄúA head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on 3rd May 2020. He last attended office on Friday 1st May 2020. He was working in an office on the second floor of BSF Force Headquarters. All persons who came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution, ‚Äù a statement from the BSF said about latest developments.

It was only on Friday that BSF the had got its entire headquarter disinfected. ‚ÄúThe disinfection of complete Block 10 CGO complex BSF force headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today light of latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, ‚Äù BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bharadwaj said.

The developments come days after 135 CRPF personnel having tested positive at its Mayur Vihar camp.

Written by Saikat Sinha Roy and M Suresh Babu

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries.

Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens.

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate.

This explains why the poor and the migrant workers of all countries including India are facing unimaginable difficulties and becoming victims of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The developments in the past two decades have forced the capitalists to think of new deals and plans to perpetuate the exploitation of the working classes. Before COVID-19, the world capitalist economy faced a crisis in 2008, when the US economy was confronted with a subprime loan crisis. The current pandemic has pushed the world economic order on to a ventilator.

There are many who think that this pandemic is affecting all countries, all communities and all classes in the same way. Therefore, we should first allow the governments to handle it and then fight for our concerns. But that is not right. Capitalists are more clever. In the name of fighting the pandemic, capitalist governments are taking more control in their hands.

In India, the BJP-RSS combine is trying to push the country towards a theocratic fascist state. Left and secular democratic forces have intensified efforts to channelise the anger of the working people against this capitalist and fascist political order, which has put the lives of millions of common people at stake by denying them their rights.

The lies and failures of the government have to be exposed. Capitalism uses religion as a tool to make people fight each other but the millions of people will understand the heinous design of communal-fascist rulers, and not allow them to divide society further. When Marx looked at the Indian social structure, he understood the place of caste in it. His writings after the Taiping Rebellion in China, Sepoy Mutiny in India (India‚Äôs first war of independence) and Black Resistance in America made him talk about the urgent need of a democratic revolution in India. Marx‚Äôs term ‚Äúdemocratic revolution‚Äù holds possibilities for the abolition of the caste system.

In the philosophical pursuit for a new world, Marxism emerged as a revolutionary theory and science. The three integral components of Marxism, as Lenin pointed, out are one, the philosophy of dialectical materialism (historical materialism), two, the theory of surplus value and three, the doctrine of class struggle as the motive force of History.

The future is going to witness intense class struggles for political power so that a new social order emerges in which the state shall ensure housing, healthcare, education and all means of livelihood to all its citizens, and equality, justice and dignity of all citizens are upheld.

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Karl Marx on May 5 (1818) while paying tributes let the working people advance their struggle to overthrow the capitalist society and to liberate from the chains of oppression and exploitation.

A BSF driver accompanying Centre‚Äôs Inter-Ministerial Central Team (ICMT) to West Bengal has tested positive for COVID-19. Following the development, 50 personnel from BSF‚Äôs Kolkata headquarters have been quarantined as the driver belonged to the force.

Two IMCTs had been sent by the Centre to West Bengal to monitor Covid-19 containment measures and lockdown implementation in the state and and send a report to the Centre.

Since the IMCTs initially did not get adequate cooperation from the state, they stayed at BSF guesthouse and used BSF vehicles . Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT as they moved around to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. This IMCT is headed by Apurva Chandra, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence.

The two IMCTs sent to West Bengal have given an unflattering report of the situation in the state and even said that the mortality rate among Covid-19 patients (12.8 per cent) is the highest in the state. The IMCT is now back in Delhi.

In contrast, the home ministry has claimed that the IMCTs sent to Gujarat have praised the efforts of the state government in fighting COVID-19. Ahmedabad and Surat are among the most severely affected cities in the state. It is not yet clear whether the MHA has asked the West Bengal IMCT members to go for testing or quarantine.

A BSF officer from Bengal said, ‚ÄúAlthough this driver was not in direct contact with the IMCT members and all drivers had been directed to stay put in their vehicles when the IMCT was out doing its work, we are tracing all contacts and taking necessary precautions.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the BSF Headquarters in Delhi have been sealed after a constable working in the office of an Additional DG-rank officer tested positive late Sunday night. The headquarters are being sanitised currently. Sources said the ADG is likely to be asked to go for testing.

This comes in the backdrop of 56 BSF personnel having tested positive so far. As many as 32 of these are suspected to have got the infection while discharging law and order duties with Delhi Police in Jama Masjid and Chandni Mahal areas.

Meanwhile, 15 personnel of the Sashatra Seema Bal, which guards the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border, have also tested positive in Delhi. They all belong to one battalion stationed at Ghitorni.

‚ÄúA head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on 3rd May 2020. He last attended office on Friday 1st May 2020. He was working in an office on the second floor of BSF Force Headquarters. All persons who came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution, ‚Äù a statement from the BSF said about latest developments.

It was only on Friday that BSF the had got its entire headquarter disinfected. ‚ÄúThe disinfection of complete Block 10 CGO complex BSF force headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today light of latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, ‚Äù BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bharadwaj said.

The developments come days after 135 CRPF personnel having tested positive at its Mayur Vihar camp.

(Representational Image) The swift action of Kerala government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April.

Written by Saikat Sinha Roy and M Suresh Babu

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

(AP/File) Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. (AP/File)

US officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press.

READ | Coronavirus not ‚Äòmanmade or genetically modified‚Äô: US intelligence agencies

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

Not classified but marked ?for official use only, the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data, the analysis states.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus was a contagion for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad ? and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China‚Äôs changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report. China informed the WHO of the outbreak on Dec. 31. It contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on January 8.

Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government‚Äôs missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information, and officials hesitant to report bad news.

There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world‚Äôs medical supplies.

In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame US intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the US, Trump wrote without citing specifics.

Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.

Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible mistake. His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC‚Äôs This Week, Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we‚Äôve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab, Pompeo said.

And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

Experts say the virus arose naturally in bats, and make it clear that they believe it wasn‚Äôt man-made. Many virologists say the chance that the outbreak was caused by a lab accident is very low, though scientists are still working to determine a point at which it may have jumped from animals to humans.

Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on US accusations that the outbreak was China‚Äôs fault, pointing to many missteps made by American officials in their own fight against the outbreak.

China‚Äôs public announcement on Jan. 20 that the virus was transmissible from person to person left the US nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic, during which the US government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits.

The US government has ignored the facts, diverted public attention and engaged in buck-passing in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for incompetence in the fight against the epidemic, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday.

With the help of science, humanity will eventually overcome the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Many theories and philosophies will emerge. Many interpretations will be presented before the people and the governments. But the question is whether the post-COVID 19 world will be the same as before or will it change, whether the capitalist order will become more inhuman and exploitative. Thomas L Friedman has written that ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is a black elephant. It is the logical outcome of our increasingly destructive wars against nature‚Äù. The emerging situation is likely to be a matter of much public debate in which Karl Marx and Marxism will occupy centerstage.

‚ÄúAll philosophers have interpreted the world in various ways. However, the point is to change it‚Äù Marx wrote in Thesis on Feuerbach. This was the fundamental premise of the philosophical pursuit of Marx and his lifelong companion Friedrich Engels. They analysed human existence, the relationship between human beings and nature and the ways in which production and the reproduction of the human species and the economy take place.

While asserting that ‚Äúlabour is the source of wealth and prime basic condition for human existence,‚Äù Marx and Engels analysed the dialectics of nature. They pointed out how the harmony among people, land, water and air leads to changes. In Capital, Marx explained that ‚Äúlabour is in the first place a process in which both man and nature participate‚Äù. Marx went on to explain that labour process was nothing but the production process. He showed how labour is the source of wealth and how labour power keeps producing surplus value. In the same work, he explained how under capitalism, surplus value is appropriated by capitalists, who are the owners of the means of production. He also explained how this appropriation of surplus value leads to accumulation of wealth at one pole and the pauperisation of the working people at another. Such inequality is reflected in the miserable working and living conditions of the working people.

While analysing the housing question of the society, especially how the bourgeoisie solves the housing question, Engels pointed out ‚Äúthe poor districts in which the workers are crowded together are the breeding places of all those epidemics which from time to time afflict out towns. Cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, smallpox and other ravaging diseases spared their germs in the pestilential air and the poisoned water of these working class quarters‚Äù. This explains why the poor and the migrant workers of all countries including India are facing unimaginable difficulties and becoming victims of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The developments in the past two decades have forced the capitalists to think of new deals and plans to perpetuate the exploitation of the working classes. Before COVID-19, the world capitalist economy faced a crisis in 2008, when the US economy was confronted with a subprime loan crisis. The current pandemic has pushed the world economic order on to a ventilator.

There are many who think that this pandemic is affecting all countries, all communities and all classes in the same way. Therefore, we should first allow the governments to handle it and then fight for our concerns. But that is not right. Capitalists are more clever. In the name of fighting the pandemic, capitalist governments are taking more control in their hands.

In India, the BJP-RSS combine is trying to push the country towards a theocratic fascist state. Left and secular democratic forces have intensified efforts to channelise the anger of the working people against this capitalist and fascist political order, which has put the lives of millions of common people at stake by denying them their rights.

The lies and failures of the government have to be exposed. Capitalism uses religion as a tool to make people fight each other but the millions of people will understand the heinous design of communal-fascist rulers, and not allow them to divide society further. When Marx looked at the Indian social structure, he understood the place of caste in it. His writings after the Taiping Rebellion in China, Sepoy Mutiny in India (India‚Äôs first war of independence) and Black Resistance in America made him talk about the urgent need of a democratic revolution in India. Marx‚Äôs term ‚Äúdemocratic revolution‚Äù holds possibilities for the abolition of the caste system.

In the philosophical pursuit for a new world, Marxism emerged as a revolutionary theory and science. The three integral components of Marxism, as Lenin pointed, out are one, the philosophy of dialectical materialism (historical materialism), two, the theory of surplus value and three, the doctrine of class struggle as the motive force of History.

The future is going to witness intense class struggles for political power so that a new social order emerges in which the state shall ensure housing, healthcare, education and all means of livelihood to all its citizens, and equality, justice and dignity of all citizens are upheld.

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Karl Marx on May 5 (1818) while paying tributes let the working people advance their struggle to overthrow the capitalist society and to liberate from the chains of oppression and exploitation.

Written by Saikat Sinha Roy and M Suresh Babu

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

US officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press.

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

Not classified but marked ?for official use only, the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data, the analysis states.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus was a contagion for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad ? and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China‚Äôs changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report. China informed the WHO of the outbreak on Dec. 31. It contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on January 8.

Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government‚Äôs missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information, and officials hesitant to report bad news.

There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world‚Äôs medical supplies.

In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame US intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the US, Trump wrote without citing specifics.

Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.

Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible mistake. His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC‚Äôs This Week, Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we‚Äôve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab, Pompeo said.

And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

Experts say the virus arose naturally in bats, and make it clear that they believe it wasn‚Äôt man-made. Many virologists say the chance that the outbreak was caused by a lab accident is very low, though scientists are still working to determine a point at which it may have jumped from animals to humans.

Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on US accusations that the outbreak was China‚Äôs fault, pointing to many missteps made by American officials in their own fight against the outbreak.

China‚Äôs public announcement on Jan. 20 that the virus was transmissible from person to person left the US nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic, during which the US government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits.

The US government has ignored the facts, diverted public attention and engaged in buck-passing in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for incompetence in the fight against the epidemic, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday.

With the help of science, humanity will eventually overcome the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Many theories and philosophies will emerge. Many interpretations will be presented before the people and the governments. But the question is whether the post-COVID 19 world will be the same as before or will it change, whether the capitalist order will become more inhuman and exploitative. Thomas L Friedman has written that ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is a black elephant. It is the logical outcome of our increasingly destructive wars against nature‚Äù. The emerging situation is likely to be a matter of much public debate in which Karl Marx and Marxism will occupy centerstage.

‚ÄúAll philosophers have interpreted the world in various ways. However, the point is to change it‚Äù Marx wrote in Thesis on Feuerbach. This was the fundamental premise of the philosophical pursuit of Marx and his lifelong companion Friedrich Engels. They analysed human existence, the relationship between human beings and nature and the ways in which production and the reproduction of the human species and the economy take place.

While asserting that ‚Äúlabour is the source of wealth and prime basic condition for human existence,‚Äù Marx and Engels analysed the dialectics of nature. They pointed out how the harmony among people, land, water and air leads to changes. In Capital, Marx explained that ‚Äúlabour is in the first place a process in which both man and nature participate‚Äù. Marx went on to explain that labour process was nothing but the production process. He showed how labour is the source of wealth and how labour power keeps producing surplus value. In the same work, he explained how under capitalism, surplus value is appropriated by capitalists, who are the owners of the means of production. He also explained how this appropriation of surplus value leads to accumulation of wealth at one pole and the pauperisation of the working people at another. Such inequality is reflected in the miserable working and living conditions of the working people.

While analysing the housing question of the society, especially how the bourgeoisie solves the housing question, Engels pointed out ‚Äúthe poor districts in which the workers are crowded together are the breeding places of all those epidemics which from time to time afflict out towns. Cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, smallpox and other ravaging diseases spared their germs in the pestilential air and the poisoned water of these working class quarters‚Äù. This explains why the poor and the migrant workers of all countries including India are facing unimaginable difficulties and becoming victims of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The developments in the past two decades have forced the capitalists to think of new deals and plans to perpetuate the exploitation of the working classes. Before COVID-19, the world capitalist economy faced a crisis in 2008, when the US economy was confronted with a subprime loan crisis. The current pandemic has pushed the world economic order on to a ventilator.

There are many who think that this pandemic is affecting all countries, all communities and all classes in the same way. Therefore, we should first allow the governments to handle it and then fight for our concerns. But that is not right. Capitalists are more clever. In the name of fighting the pandemic, capitalist governments are taking more control in their hands.

In India, the BJP-RSS combine is trying to push the country towards a theocratic fascist state. Left and secular democratic forces have intensified efforts to channelise the anger of the working people against this capitalist and fascist political order, which has put the lives of millions of common people at stake by denying them their rights.

The lies and failures of the government have to be exposed. Capitalism uses religion as a tool to make people fight each other but the millions of people will understand the heinous design of communal-fascist rulers, and not allow them to divide society further. When Marx looked at the Indian social structure, he understood the place of caste in it. His writings after the Taiping Rebellion in China, Sepoy Mutiny in India (India‚Äôs first war of independence) and Black Resistance in America made him talk about the urgent need of a democratic revolution in India. Marx‚Äôs term ‚Äúdemocratic revolution‚Äù holds possibilities for the abolition of the caste system.

In the philosophical pursuit for a new world, Marxism emerged as a revolutionary theory and science. The three integral components of Marxism, as Lenin pointed, out are one, the philosophy of dialectical materialism (historical materialism), two, the theory of surplus value and three, the doctrine of class struggle as the motive force of History.

The future is going to witness intense class struggles for political power so that a new social order emerges in which the state shall ensure housing, healthcare, education and all means of livelihood to all its citizens, and equality, justice and dignity of all citizens are upheld.

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Karl Marx on May 5 (1818) while paying tributes let the working people advance their struggle to overthrow the capitalist society and to liberate from the chains of oppression and exploitation.

(Express photo) Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT sent to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. (Express photo)

A BSF driver accompanying Centre‚Äôs Inter-Ministerial Central Team (ICMT) to West Bengal has tested positive for COVID-19. Following the development, 50 personnel from BSF‚Äôs Kolkata headquarters have been quarantined as the driver belonged to the force.

Two IMCTs had been sent by the Centre to West Bengal to monitor Covid-19 containment measures and lockdown implementation in the state and and send a report to the Centre.

Since the IMCTs initially did not get adequate cooperation from the state, they stayed at BSF guesthouse and used BSF vehicles . Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT as they moved around to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. This IMCT is headed by Apurva Chandra, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence.

The two IMCTs sent to West Bengal have given an unflattering report of the situation in the state and even said that the mortality rate among Covid-19 patients (12.8 per cent) is the highest in the state. The IMCT is now back in Delhi.

In contrast, the home ministry has claimed that the IMCTs sent to Gujarat have praised the efforts of the state government in fighting COVID-19. Ahmedabad and Surat are among the most severely affected cities in the state. It is not yet clear whether the MHA has asked the West Bengal IMCT members to go for testing or quarantine.

A BSF officer from Bengal said, ‚ÄúAlthough this driver was not in direct contact with the IMCT members and all drivers had been directed to stay put in their vehicles when the IMCT was out doing its work, we are tracing all contacts and taking necessary precautions.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the BSF Headquarters in Delhi have been sealed after a constable working in the office of an Additional DG-rank officer tested positive late Sunday night. The headquarters are being sanitised currently. Sources said the ADG is likely to be asked to go for testing.

This comes in the backdrop of 56 BSF personnel having tested positive so far. As many as 32 of these are suspected to have got the infection while discharging law and order duties with Delhi Police in Jama Masjid and Chandni Mahal areas.

Meanwhile, 15 personnel of the Sashatra Seema Bal, which guards the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border, have also tested positive in Delhi. They all belong to one battalion stationed at Ghitorni.

‚ÄúA head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on 3rd May 2020. He last attended office on Friday 1st May 2020. He was working in an office on the second floor of BSF Force Headquarters. All persons who came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution, ‚Äù a statement from the BSF said about latest developments.

It was only on Friday that BSF the had got its entire headquarter disinfected. ‚ÄúThe disinfection of complete Block 10 CGO complex BSF force headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today light of latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, ‚Äù BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bharadwaj said.

The developments come days after 135 CRPF personnel having tested positive at its Mayur Vihar camp.

(Representational Image) The swift action of Kerala government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April.

Written by Saikat Sinha Roy and M Suresh Babu

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate.

In contrast, the home ministry has claimed that the IMCTs sent to Gujarat have praised the efforts of the state government in fighting COVID-19. Ahmedabad and Surat are among the most severely affected cities in the state. It is not yet clear whether the MHA has asked the West Bengal IMCT members to go for testing or quarantine.

A BSF officer from Bengal said, ‚ÄúAlthough this driver was not in direct contact with the IMCT members and all drivers had been directed to stay put in their vehicles when the IMCT was out doing its work, we are tracing all contacts and taking necessary precautions.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the BSF Headquarters in Delhi have been sealed after a constable working in the office of an Additional DG-rank officer tested positive late Sunday night. The headquarters are being sanitised currently. Sources said the ADG is likely to be asked to go for testing.

This comes in the backdrop of 56 BSF personnel having tested positive so far. As many as 32 of these are suspected to have got the infection while discharging law and order duties with Delhi Police in Jama Masjid and Chandni Mahal areas.

Meanwhile, 15 personnel of the Sashatra Seema Bal, which guards the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border, have also tested positive in Delhi. They all belong to one battalion stationed at Ghitorni.

‚ÄúA head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on 3rd May 2020. He last attended office on Friday 1st May 2020. He was working in an office on the second floor of BSF Force Headquarters. All persons who came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution, ‚Äù a statement from the BSF said about latest developments.

It was only on Friday that BSF the had got its entire headquarter disinfected. ‚ÄúThe disinfection of complete Block 10 CGO complex BSF force headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today light of latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, ‚Äù BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bharadwaj said.

The developments come days after 135 CRPF personnel having tested positive at its Mayur Vihar camp.

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

(AP/File) Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. (AP/File)

US officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press.

READ | Coronavirus not ‚Äòmanmade or genetically modified‚Äô: US intelligence agencies

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

Not classified but marked ?for official use only, the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data, the analysis states.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus was a contagion for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad ? and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China‚Äôs changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report. China informed the WHO of the outbreak on Dec. 31. It contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on January 8.

Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government‚Äôs missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information, and officials hesitant to report bad news.

There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world‚Äôs medical supplies.

In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame US intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the US, Trump wrote without citing specifics.

Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.

Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible mistake. His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC‚Äôs This Week, Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we‚Äôve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab, Pompeo said.

And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

Experts say the virus arose naturally in bats, and make it clear that they believe it wasn‚Äôt man-made. Many virologists say the chance that the outbreak was caused by a lab accident is very low, though scientists are still working to determine a point at which it may have jumped from animals to humans.

Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on US accusations that the outbreak was China‚Äôs fault, pointing to many missteps made by American officials in their own fight against the outbreak.

China‚Äôs public announcement on Jan. 20 that the virus was transmissible from person to person left the US nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic, during which the US government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits.

The US government has ignored the facts, diverted public attention and engaged in buck-passing in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for incompetence in the fight against the epidemic, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday.

With the help of science, humanity will eventually overcome the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Many theories and philosophies will emerge. Many interpretations will be presented before the people and the governments. But the question is whether the post-COVID 19 world will be the same as before or will it change, whether the capitalist order will become more inhuman and exploitative. Thomas L Friedman has written that ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is a black elephant. It is the logical outcome of our increasingly destructive wars against nature‚Äù. The emerging situation is likely to be a matter of much public debate in which Karl Marx and Marxism will occupy centerstage.

‚ÄúAll philosophers have interpreted the world in various ways. However, the point is to change it‚Äù Marx wrote in Thesis on Feuerbach. This was the fundamental premise of the philosophical pursuit of Marx and his lifelong companion Friedrich Engels. They analysed human existence, the relationship between human beings and nature and the ways in which production and the reproduction of the human species and the economy take place.

While asserting that ‚Äúlabour is the source of wealth and prime basic condition for human existence,‚Äù Marx and Engels analysed the dialectics of nature. They pointed out how the harmony among people, land, water and air leads to changes. In Capital, Marx explained that ‚Äúlabour is in the first place a process in which both man and nature participate‚Äù. Marx went on to explain that labour process was nothing but the production process. He showed how labour is the source of wealth and how labour power keeps producing surplus value. In the same work, he explained how under capitalism, surplus value is appropriated by capitalists, who are the owners of the means of production. He also explained how this appropriation of surplus value leads to accumulation of wealth at one pole and the pauperisation of the working people at another. Such inequality is reflected in the miserable working and living conditions of the working people.

While analysing the housing question of the society, especially how the bourgeoisie solves the housing question, Engels pointed out ‚Äúthe poor districts in which the workers are crowded together are the breeding places of all those epidemics which from time to time afflict out towns. Cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, smallpox and other ravaging diseases spared their germs in the pestilential air and the poisoned water of these working class quarters‚Äù. This explains why the poor and the migrant workers of all countries including India are facing unimaginable difficulties and becoming victims of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The developments in the past two decades have forced the capitalists to think of new deals and plans to perpetuate the exploitation of the working classes. Before COVID-19, the world capitalist economy faced a crisis in 2008, when the US economy was confronted with a subprime loan crisis. The current pandemic has pushed the world economic order on to a ventilator.

There are many who think that this pandemic is affecting all countries, all communities and all classes in the same way. Therefore, we should first allow the governments to handle it and then fight for our concerns. But that is not right. Capitalists are more clever. In the name of fighting the pandemic, capitalist governments are taking more control in their hands.

In India, the BJP-RSS combine is trying to push the country towards a theocratic fascist state. Left and secular democratic forces have intensified efforts to channelise the anger of the working people against this capitalist and fascist political order, which has put the lives of millions of common people at stake by denying them their rights.

The lies and failures of the government have to be exposed. Capitalism uses religion as a tool to make people fight each other but the millions of people will understand the heinous design of communal-fascist rulers, and not allow them to divide society further. When Marx looked at the Indian social structure, he understood the place of caste in it. His writings after the Taiping Rebellion in China, Sepoy Mutiny in India (India‚Äôs first war of independence) and Black Resistance in America made him talk about the urgent need of a democratic revolution in India. Marx‚Äôs term ‚Äúdemocratic revolution‚Äù holds possibilities for the abolition of the caste system.

In the philosophical pursuit for a new world, Marxism emerged as a revolutionary theory and science. The three integral components of Marxism, as Lenin pointed, out are one, the philosophy of dialectical materialism (historical materialism), two, the theory of surplus value and three, the doctrine of class struggle as the motive force of History.

The future is going to witness intense class struggles for political power so that a new social order emerges in which the state shall ensure housing, healthcare, education and all means of livelihood to all its citizens, and equality, justice and dignity of all citizens are upheld.

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Karl Marx on May 5 (1818) while paying tributes let the working people advance their struggle to overthrow the capitalist society and to liberate from the chains of oppression and exploitation.

A BSF driver accompanying Centre‚Äôs Inter-Ministerial Central Team (ICMT) to West Bengal has tested positive for COVID-19. Following the development, 50 personnel from BSF‚Äôs Kolkata headquarters have been quarantined as the driver belonged to the force.

Two IMCTs had been sent by the Centre to West Bengal to monitor Covid-19 containment measures and lockdown implementation in the state and and send a report to the Centre.

Since the IMCTs initially did not get adequate cooperation from the state, they stayed at BSF guesthouse and used BSF vehicles . Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT as they moved around to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. This IMCT is headed by Apurva Chandra, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence.

The two IMCTs sent to West Bengal have given an unflattering report of the situation in the state and even said that the mortality rate among Covid-19 patients (12.8 per cent) is the highest in the state. The IMCT is now back in Delhi.

In contrast, the home ministry has claimed that the IMCTs sent to Gujarat have praised the efforts of the state government in fighting COVID-19. Ahmedabad and Surat are among the most severely affected cities in the state. It is not yet clear whether the MHA has asked the West Bengal IMCT members to go for testing or quarantine.

A BSF officer from Bengal said, ‚ÄúAlthough this driver was not in direct contact with the IMCT members and all drivers had been directed to stay put in their vehicles when the IMCT was out doing its work, we are tracing all contacts and taking necessary precautions.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the BSF Headquarters in Delhi have been sealed after a constable working in the office of an Additional DG-rank officer tested positive late Sunday night. The headquarters are being sanitised currently. Sources said the ADG is likely to be asked to go for testing.

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s.

Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development.

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

Experts say the virus arose naturally in bats, and make it clear that they believe it wasn‚Äôt man-made. Many virologists say the chance that the outbreak was caused by a lab accident is very low, though scientists are still working to determine a point at which it may have jumped from animals to humans.

Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on US accusations that the outbreak was China‚Äôs fault, pointing to many missteps made by American officials in their own fight against the outbreak.

China‚Äôs public announcement on Jan. 20 that the virus was transmissible from person to person left the US nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic, during which the US government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits.

The US government has ignored the facts, diverted public attention and engaged in buck-passing in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for incompetence in the fight against the epidemic, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday.

With the help of science, humanity will eventually overcome the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Many theories and philosophies will emerge. Many interpretations will be presented before the people and the governments. But the question is whether the post-COVID 19 world will be the same as before or will it change, whether the capitalist order will become more inhuman and exploitative. Thomas L Friedman has written that ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is a black elephant. It is the logical outcome of our increasingly destructive wars against nature‚Äù. The emerging situation is likely to be a matter of much public debate in which Karl Marx and Marxism will occupy centerstage.

‚ÄúAll philosophers have interpreted the world in various ways. However, the point is to change it‚Äù Marx wrote in Thesis on Feuerbach. This was the fundamental premise of the philosophical pursuit of Marx and his lifelong companion Friedrich Engels. They analysed human existence, the relationship between human beings and nature and the ways in which production and the reproduction of the human species and the economy take place.

While asserting that ‚Äúlabour is the source of wealth and prime basic condition for human existence,‚Äù Marx and Engels analysed the dialectics of nature. They pointed out how the harmony among people, land, water and air leads to changes. In Capital, Marx explained that ‚Äúlabour is in the first place a process in which both man and nature participate‚Äù. Marx went on to explain that labour process was nothing but the production process. He showed how labour is the source of wealth and how labour power keeps producing surplus value. In the same work, he explained how under capitalism, surplus value is appropriated by capitalists, who are the owners of the means of production. He also explained how this appropriation of surplus value leads to accumulation of wealth at one pole and the pauperisation of the working people at another. Such inequality is reflected in the miserable working and living conditions of the working people.

While analysing the housing question of the society, especially how the bourgeoisie solves the housing question, Engels pointed out ‚Äúthe poor districts in which the workers are crowded together are the breeding places of all those epidemics which from time to time afflict out towns. Cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, smallpox and other ravaging diseases spared their germs in the pestilential air and the poisoned water of these working class quarters‚Äù. This explains why the poor and the migrant workers of all countries including India are facing unimaginable difficulties and becoming victims of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The developments in the past two decades have forced the capitalists to think of new deals and plans to perpetuate the exploitation of the working classes. Before COVID-19, the world capitalist economy faced a crisis in 2008, when the US economy was confronted with a subprime loan crisis. The current pandemic has pushed the world economic order on to a ventilator.

There are many who think that this pandemic is affecting all countries, all communities and all classes in the same way. Therefore, we should first allow the governments to handle it and then fight for our concerns. But that is not right. Capitalists are more clever. In the name of fighting the pandemic, capitalist governments are taking more control in their hands.

In India, the BJP-RSS combine is trying to push the country towards a theocratic fascist state. Left and secular democratic forces have intensified efforts to channelise the anger of the working people against this capitalist and fascist political order, which has put the lives of millions of common people at stake by denying them their rights.

The lies and failures of the government have to be exposed. Capitalism uses religion as a tool to make people fight each other but the millions of people will understand the heinous design of communal-fascist rulers, and not allow them to divide society further. When Marx looked at the Indian social structure, he understood the place of caste in it. His writings after the Taiping Rebellion in China, Sepoy Mutiny in India (India‚Äôs first war of independence) and Black Resistance in America made him talk about the urgent need of a democratic revolution in India. Marx‚Äôs term ‚Äúdemocratic revolution‚Äù holds possibilities for the abolition of the caste system.

In the philosophical pursuit for a new world, Marxism emerged as a revolutionary theory and science. The three integral components of Marxism, as Lenin pointed, out are one, the philosophy of dialectical materialism (historical materialism), two, the theory of surplus value and three, the doctrine of class struggle as the motive force of History.

The future is going to witness intense class struggles for political power so that a new social order emerges in which the state shall ensure housing, healthcare, education and all means of livelihood to all its citizens, and equality, justice and dignity of all citizens are upheld.

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Karl Marx on May 5 (1818) while paying tributes let the working people advance their struggle to overthrow the capitalist society and to liberate from the chains of oppression and exploitation.

A BSF driver accompanying Centre‚Äôs Inter-Ministerial Central Team (ICMT) to West Bengal has tested positive for COVID-19. Following the development, 50 personnel from BSF‚Äôs Kolkata headquarters have been quarantined as the driver belonged to the force.

Two IMCTs had been sent by the Centre to West Bengal to monitor Covid-19 containment measures and lockdown implementation in the state and and send a report to the Centre.

Since the IMCTs initially did not get adequate cooperation from the state, they stayed at BSF guesthouse and used BSF vehicles . Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT as they moved around to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. This IMCT is headed by Apurva Chandra, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence.

The two IMCTs sent to West Bengal have given an unflattering report of the situation in the state and even said that the mortality rate among Covid-19 patients (12.8 per cent) is the highest in the state. The IMCT is now back in Delhi.

In contrast, the home ministry has claimed that the IMCTs sent to Gujarat have praised the efforts of the state government in fighting COVID-19. Ahmedabad and Surat are among the most severely affected cities in the state. It is not yet clear whether the MHA has asked the West Bengal IMCT members to go for testing or quarantine.

A BSF officer from Bengal said, ‚ÄúAlthough this driver was not in direct contact with the IMCT members and all drivers had been directed to stay put in their vehicles when the IMCT was out doing its work, we are tracing all contacts and taking necessary precautions.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the BSF Headquarters in Delhi have been sealed after a constable working in the office of an Additional DG-rank officer tested positive late Sunday night. The headquarters are being sanitised currently. Sources said the ADG is likely to be asked to go for testing.

This comes in the backdrop of 56 BSF personnel having tested positive so far. As many as 32 of these are suspected to have got the infection while discharging law and order duties with Delhi Police in Jama Masjid and Chandni Mahal areas.

Meanwhile, 15 personnel of the Sashatra Seema Bal, which guards the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border, have also tested positive in Delhi. They all belong to one battalion stationed at Ghitorni.

‚ÄúA head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on 3rd May 2020. He last attended office on Friday 1st May 2020. He was working in an office on the second floor of BSF Force Headquarters. All persons who came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution, ‚Äù a statement from the BSF said about latest developments.

It was only on Friday that BSF the had got its entire headquarter disinfected. ‚ÄúThe disinfection of complete Block 10 CGO complex BSF force headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today light of latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, ‚Äù BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bharadwaj said.

The developments come days after 135 CRPF personnel having tested positive at its Mayur Vihar camp.

(Representational Image) The swift action of Kerala government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. (Representational Image)

Written by Saikat Sinha Roy and M Suresh Babu

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

(AP/File) Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. (AP/File)

US officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press.

READ | Coronavirus not ‚Äòmanmade or genetically modified‚Äô: US intelligence agencies

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

Not classified but marked ?for official use only, the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data, the analysis states.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus was a contagion for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad ? and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China‚Äôs changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report. China informed the WHO of the outbreak on Dec. 31. It contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on January 8.

Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government‚Äôs missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information, and officials hesitant to report bad news.

There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world‚Äôs medical supplies.

In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame US intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the US, Trump wrote without citing specifics.

Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.

Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible mistake. His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC‚Äôs This Week, Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we‚Äôve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab, Pompeo said.

And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

Experts say the virus arose naturally in bats, and make it clear that they believe it wasn‚Äôt man-made. Many virologists say the chance that the outbreak was caused by a lab accident is very low, though scientists are still working to determine a point at which it may have jumped from animals to humans.

Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on US accusations that the outbreak was China‚Äôs fault, pointing to many missteps made by American officials in their own fight against the outbreak.

China‚Äôs public announcement on Jan. 20 that the virus was transmissible from person to person left the US nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic, during which the US government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits.

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

US officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press.

READ | Coronavirus not ‚Äòmanmade or genetically modified‚Äô: US intelligence agencies

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

Not classified but marked ?for official use only, the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data, the analysis states.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus was a contagion for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad ? and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China‚Äôs changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report. China informed the WHO of the outbreak on Dec. 31. It contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on January 8.

Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government‚Äôs missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information, and officials hesitant to report bad news.

There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world‚Äôs medical supplies.

In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame US intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the US, Trump wrote without citing specifics.

Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.

Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible mistake. His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC‚Äôs This Week, Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we‚Äôve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab, Pompeo said.

And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

Experts say the virus arose naturally in bats, and make it clear that they believe it wasn‚Äôt man-made. Many virologists say the chance that the outbreak was caused by a lab accident is very low, though scientists are still working to determine a point at which it may have jumped from animals to humans.

Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on US accusations that the outbreak was China‚Äôs fault, pointing to many missteps made by American officials in their own fight against the outbreak.

China‚Äôs public announcement on Jan. 20 that the virus was transmissible from person to person left the US nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic, during which the US government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits.

The US government has ignored the facts, diverted public attention and engaged in buck-passing in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for incompetence in the fight against the epidemic, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday.

With the help of science, humanity will eventually overcome the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Many theories and philosophies will emerge. Many interpretations will be presented before the people and the governments. But the question is whether the post-COVID 19 world will be the same as before or will it change, whether the capitalist order will become more inhuman and exploitative. Thomas L Friedman has written that ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is a black elephant. It is the logical outcome of our increasingly destructive wars against nature‚Äù. The emerging situation is likely to be a matter of much public debate in which Karl Marx and Marxism will occupy centerstage.

‚ÄúAll philosophers have interpreted the world in various ways. However, the point is to change it‚Äù Marx wrote in Thesis on Feuerbach. This was the fundamental premise of the philosophical pursuit of Marx and his lifelong companion Friedrich Engels. They analysed human existence, the relationship between human beings and nature and the ways in which production and the reproduction of the human species and the economy take place.

While asserting that ‚Äúlabour is the source of wealth and prime basic condition for human existence,‚Äù Marx and Engels analysed the dialectics of nature. They pointed out how the harmony among people, land, water and air leads to changes. In Capital, Marx explained that ‚Äúlabour is in the first place a process in which both man and nature participate‚Äù. Marx went on to explain that labour process was nothing but the production process. He showed how labour is the source of wealth and how labour power keeps producing surplus value. In the same work, he explained how under capitalism, surplus value is appropriated by capitalists, who are the owners of the means of production. He also explained how this appropriation of surplus value leads to accumulation of wealth at one pole and the pauperisation of the working people at another. Such inequality is reflected in the miserable working and living conditions of the working people.

While analysing the housing question of the society, especially how the bourgeoisie solves the housing question, Engels pointed out ‚Äúthe poor districts in which the workers are crowded together are the breeding places of all those epidemics which from time to time afflict out towns. Cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, smallpox and other ravaging diseases spared their germs in the pestilential air and the poisoned water of these working class quarters‚Äù. This explains why the poor and the migrant workers of all countries including India are facing unimaginable difficulties and becoming victims of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The developments in the past two decades have forced the capitalists to think of new deals and plans to perpetuate the exploitation of the working classes. Before COVID-19, the world capitalist economy faced a crisis in 2008, when the US economy was confronted with a subprime loan crisis. The current pandemic has pushed the world economic order on to a ventilator.

There are many who think that this pandemic is affecting all countries, all communities and all classes in the same way. Therefore, we should first allow the governments to handle it and then fight for our concerns. But that is not right. Capitalists are more clever. In the name of fighting the pandemic, capitalist governments are taking more control in their hands.

In India, the BJP-RSS combine is trying to push the country towards a theocratic fascist state. Left and secular democratic forces have intensified efforts to channelise the anger of the working people against this capitalist and fascist political order, which has put the lives of millions of common people at stake by denying them their rights.

The lies and failures of the government have to be exposed. Capitalism uses religion as a tool to make people fight each other but the millions of people will understand the heinous design of communal-fascist rulers, and not allow them to divide society further. When Marx looked at the Indian social structure, he understood the place of caste in it. His writings after the Taiping Rebellion in China, Sepoy Mutiny in India (India‚Äôs first war of independence) and Black Resistance in America made him talk about the urgent need of a democratic revolution in India. Marx‚Äôs term ‚Äúdemocratic revolution‚Äù holds possibilities for the abolition of the caste system.

In the philosophical pursuit for a new world, Marxism emerged as a revolutionary theory and science. The three integral components of Marxism, as Lenin pointed, out are one, the philosophy of dialectical materialism (historical materialism), two, the theory of surplus value and three, the doctrine of class struggle as the motive force of History.

The future is going to witness intense class struggles for political power so that a new social order emerges in which the state shall ensure housing, healthcare, education and all means of livelihood to all its citizens, and equality, justice and dignity of all citizens are upheld.

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Karl Marx on May 5 (1818) while paying tributes let the working people advance their struggle to overthrow the capitalist society and to liberate from the chains of oppression and exploitation.

(Express photo) Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT sent to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. (Express photo)

A BSF driver accompanying Centre‚Äôs Inter-Ministerial Central Team (ICMT) to West Bengal has tested positive for COVID-19. Following the development, 50 personnel from BSF‚Äôs Kolkata headquarters have been quarantined as the driver belonged to the force.

Two IMCTs had been sent by the Centre to West Bengal to monitor Covid-19 containment measures and lockdown implementation in the state and and send a report to the Centre.

Since the IMCTs initially did not get adequate cooperation from the state, they stayed at BSF guesthouse and used BSF vehicles . Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT as they moved around to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. This IMCT is headed by Apurva Chandra, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence.

The two IMCTs sent to West Bengal have given an unflattering report of the situation in the state and even said that the mortality rate among Covid-19 patients (12.8 per cent) is the highest in the state. The IMCT is now back in Delhi.

In contrast, the home ministry has claimed that the IMCTs sent to Gujarat have praised the efforts of the state government in fighting COVID-19. Ahmedabad and Surat are among the most severely affected cities in the state. It is not yet clear whether the MHA has asked the West Bengal IMCT members to go for testing or quarantine.

A BSF officer from Bengal said, ‚ÄúAlthough this driver was not in direct contact with the IMCT members and all drivers had been directed to stay put in their vehicles when the IMCT was out doing its work, we are tracing all contacts and taking necessary precautions.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the BSF Headquarters in Delhi have been sealed after a constable working in the office of an Additional DG-rank officer tested positive late Sunday night. The headquarters are being sanitised currently. Sources said the ADG is likely to be asked to go for testing.

This comes in the backdrop of 56 BSF personnel having tested positive so far. As many as 32 of these are suspected to have got the infection while discharging law and order duties with Delhi Police in Jama Masjid and Chandni Mahal areas.

Meanwhile, 15 personnel of the Sashatra Seema Bal, which guards the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border, have also tested positive in Delhi. They all belong to one battalion stationed at Ghitorni.

‚ÄúA head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on 3rd May 2020. He last attended office on Friday 1st May 2020. He was working in an office on the second floor of BSF Force Headquarters. All persons who came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution, ‚Äù a statement from the BSF said about latest developments.

It was only on Friday that BSF the had got its entire headquarter disinfected. ‚ÄúThe disinfection of complete Block 10 CGO complex BSF force headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today light of latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, ‚Äù BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bharadwaj said.

The developments come days after 135 CRPF personnel having tested positive at its Mayur Vihar camp.

Written by Saikat Sinha Roy and M Suresh Babu

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate.

Left and secular democratic forces have intensified efforts to channelise the anger of the working people against this capitalist and fascist political order, which has put the lives of millions of common people at stake by denying them their rights.

The lies and failures of the government have to be exposed. Capitalism uses religion as a tool to make people fight each other but the millions of people will understand the heinous design of communal-fascist rulers, and not allow them to divide society further. When Marx looked at the Indian social structure, he understood the place of caste in it. His writings after the Taiping Rebellion in China, Sepoy Mutiny in India (India‚Äôs first war of independence) and Black Resistance in America made him talk about the urgent need of a democratic revolution in India. Marx‚Äôs term ‚Äúdemocratic revolution‚Äù holds possibilities for the abolition of the caste system.

In the philosophical pursuit for a new world, Marxism emerged as a revolutionary theory and science. The three integral components of Marxism, as Lenin pointed, out are one, the philosophy of dialectical materialism (historical materialism), two, the theory of surplus value and three, the doctrine of class struggle as the motive force of History.

The future is going to witness intense class struggles for political power so that a new social order emerges in which the state shall ensure housing, healthcare, education and all means of livelihood to all its citizens, and equality, justice and dignity of all citizens are upheld.

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Karl Marx on May 5 (1818) while paying tributes let the working people advance their struggle to overthrow the capitalist society and to liberate from the chains of oppression and exploitation.

A BSF driver accompanying Centre‚Äôs Inter-Ministerial Central Team (ICMT) to West Bengal has tested positive for COVID-19. Following the development, 50 personnel from BSF‚Äôs Kolkata headquarters have been quarantined as the driver belonged to the force.

Two IMCTs had been sent by the Centre to West Bengal to monitor Covid-19 containment measures and lockdown implementation in the state and and send a report to the Centre.

Since the IMCTs initially did not get adequate cooperation from the state, they stayed at BSF guesthouse and used BSF vehicles . Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT as they moved around to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. This IMCT is headed by Apurva Chandra, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence.

The two IMCTs sent to West Bengal have given an unflattering report of the situation in the state and even said that the mortality rate among Covid-19 patients (12.8 per cent) is the highest in the state. The IMCT is now back in Delhi.

In contrast, the home ministry has claimed that the IMCTs sent to Gujarat have praised the efforts of the state government in fighting COVID-19. Ahmedabad and Surat are among the most severely affected cities in the state. It is not yet clear whether the MHA has asked the West Bengal IMCT members to go for testing or quarantine.

A BSF officer from Bengal said, ‚ÄúAlthough this driver was not in direct contact with the IMCT members and all drivers had been directed to stay put in their vehicles when the IMCT was out doing its work, we are tracing all contacts and taking necessary precautions.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the BSF Headquarters in Delhi have been sealed after a constable working in the office of an Additional DG-rank officer tested positive late Sunday night. The headquarters are being sanitised currently. Sources said the ADG is likely to be asked to go for testing.

This comes in the backdrop of 56 BSF personnel having tested positive so far. As many as 32 of these are suspected to have got the infection while discharging law and order duties with Delhi Police in Jama Masjid and Chandni Mahal areas.

Meanwhile, 15 personnel of the Sashatra Seema Bal, which guards the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border, have also tested positive in Delhi. They all belong to one battalion stationed at Ghitorni.

‚ÄúA head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on 3rd May 2020. He last attended office on Friday 1st May 2020. He was working in an office on the second floor of BSF Force Headquarters. All persons who came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution, ‚Äù a statement from the BSF said about latest developments.

It was only on Friday that BSF the had got its entire headquarter disinfected. ‚ÄúThe disinfection of complete Block 10 CGO complex BSF force headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today light of latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, ‚Äù BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bharadwaj said.

The developments come days after 135 CRPF personnel having tested positive at its Mayur Vihar camp.

(Representational Image) The swift action of Kerala government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April.

Written by Saikat Sinha Roy and M Suresh Babu

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

(AP/File) Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. (AP/File)

US officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press.

READ | Coronavirus not ‚Äòmanmade or genetically modified‚Äô: US intelligence agencies

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

Not classified but marked ?for official use only, the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data, the analysis states.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus was a contagion for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad ? and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China‚Äôs changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report. China informed the WHO of the outbreak on Dec. 31. It contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on January 8.

Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government‚Äôs missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information, and officials hesitant to report bad news.

There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world‚Äôs medical supplies.

In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame US intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the US, Trump wrote without citing specifics.

Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.

Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible mistake. His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC‚Äôs This Week, Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we‚Äôve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab, Pompeo said.

And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

Experts say the virus arose naturally in bats, and make it clear that they believe it wasn‚Äôt man-made. Many virologists say the chance that the outbreak was caused by a lab accident is very low, though scientists are still working to determine a point at which it may have jumped from animals to humans.

Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on US accusations that the outbreak was China‚Äôs fault, pointing to many missteps made by American officials in their own fight against the outbreak.

China‚Äôs public announcement on Jan. 20 that the virus was transmissible from person to person left the US nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic, during which the US government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits.

The US government has ignored the facts, diverted public attention and engaged in buck-passing in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for incompetence in the fight against the epidemic, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday.

With the help of science, humanity will eventually overcome the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Many theories and philosophies will emerge. Many interpretations will be presented before the people and the governments. But the question is whether the post-COVID 19 world will be the same as before or will it change, whether the capitalist order will become more inhuman and exploitative. Thomas L Friedman has written that ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is a black elephant. It is the logical outcome of our increasingly destructive wars against nature‚Äù. The emerging situation is likely to be a matter of much public debate in which Karl Marx and Marxism will occupy centerstage.

‚ÄúAll philosophers have interpreted the world in various ways. However, the point is to change it‚Äù Marx wrote in Thesis on Feuerbach. This was the fundamental premise of the philosophical pursuit of Marx and his lifelong companion Friedrich Engels. They analysed human existence, the relationship between human beings and nature and the ways in which production and the reproduction of the human species and the economy take place.

While asserting that ‚Äúlabour is the source of wealth and prime basic condition for human existence,‚Äù Marx and Engels analysed the dialectics of nature. They pointed out how the harmony among people, land, water and air leads to changes. In Capital, Marx explained that ‚Äúlabour is in the first place a process in which both man and nature participate‚Äù. Marx went on to explain that labour process was nothing but the production process. He showed how labour is the source of wealth and how labour power keeps producing surplus value. In the same work, he explained how under capitalism, surplus value is appropriated by capitalists, who are the owners of the means of production. He also explained how this appropriation of surplus value leads to accumulation of wealth at one pole and the pauperisation of the working people at another. Such inequality is reflected in the miserable working and living conditions of the working people.

While analysing the housing question of the society, especially how the bourgeoisie solves the housing question, Engels pointed out ‚Äúthe poor districts in which the workers are crowded together are the breeding places of all those epidemics which from time to time afflict out towns. Cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, smallpox and other ravaging diseases spared their germs in the pestilential air and the poisoned water of these working class quarters‚Äù. This explains why the poor and the migrant workers of all countries including India are facing unimaginable difficulties and becoming victims of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The developments in the past two decades have forced the capitalists to think of new deals and plans to perpetuate the exploitation of the working classes. Before COVID-19, the world capitalist economy faced a crisis in 2008, when the US economy was confronted with a subprime loan crisis. The current pandemic has pushed the world economic order on to a ventilator.

There are many who think that this pandemic is affecting all countries, all communities and all classes in the same way. Therefore, we should first allow the governments to handle it and then fight for our concerns. But that is not right. Capitalists are more clever. In the name of fighting the pandemic, capitalist governments are taking more control in their hands.

In India, the BJP-RSS combine is trying to push the country towards a theocratic fascist state. Left and secular democratic forces have intensified efforts to channelise the anger of the working people against this capitalist and fascist political order, which has put the lives of millions of common people at stake by denying them their rights.

The lies and failures of the government have to be exposed. Capitalism uses religion as a tool to make people fight each other but the millions of people will understand the heinous design of communal-fascist rulers, and not allow them to divide society further. When Marx looked at the Indian social structure, he understood the place of caste in it. His writings after the Taiping Rebellion in China, Sepoy Mutiny in India (India‚Äôs first war of independence) and Black Resistance in America made him talk about the urgent need of a democratic revolution in India. Marx‚Äôs term ‚Äúdemocratic revolution‚Äù holds possibilities for the abolition of the caste system.

In the philosophical pursuit for a new world, Marxism emerged as a revolutionary theory and science. The three integral components of Marxism, as Lenin pointed, out are one, the philosophy of dialectical materialism (historical materialism), two, the theory of surplus value and three, the doctrine of class struggle as the motive force of History.

The future is going to witness intense class struggles for political power so that a new social order emerges in which the state shall ensure housing, healthcare, education and all means of livelihood to all its citizens, and equality, justice and dignity of all citizens are upheld.

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Karl Marx on May 5 (1818) while paying tributes let the working people advance their struggle to overthrow the capitalist society and to liberate from the chains of oppression and exploitation.

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

US officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press.

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

Not classified but marked ?for official use only, the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data, the analysis states.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus was a contagion for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad ? and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China‚Äôs changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report. China informed the WHO of the outbreak on Dec. 31. It contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on January 8.

Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government‚Äôs missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information, and officials hesitant to report bad news.

There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world‚Äôs medical supplies.

In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame US intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the US, Trump wrote without citing specifics.

Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.

Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible mistake. His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC‚Äôs This Week, Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we‚Äôve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab, Pompeo said.

And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

Experts say the virus arose naturally in bats, and make it clear that they believe it wasn‚Äôt man-made. Many virologists say the chance that the outbreak was caused by a lab accident is very low, though scientists are still working to determine a point at which it may have jumped from animals to humans.

Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on US accusations that the outbreak was China‚Äôs fault, pointing to many missteps made by American officials in their own fight against the outbreak.

China‚Äôs public announcement on Jan. 20 that the virus was transmissible from person to person left the US nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic, during which the US government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits.

The US government has ignored the facts, diverted public attention and engaged in buck-passing in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for incompetence in the fight against the epidemic, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday.

With the help of science, humanity will eventually overcome the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Many theories and philosophies will emerge. Many interpretations will be presented before the people and the governments. But the question is whether the post-COVID 19 world will be the same as before or will it change, whether the capitalist order will become more inhuman and exploitative. Thomas L Friedman has written that ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is a black elephant. It is the logical outcome of our increasingly destructive wars against nature‚Äù. The emerging situation is likely to be a matter of much public debate in which Karl Marx and Marxism will occupy centerstage.

‚ÄúAll philosophers have interpreted the world in various ways. However, the point is to change it‚Äù Marx wrote in Thesis on Feuerbach. This was the fundamental premise of the philosophical pursuit of Marx and his lifelong companion Friedrich Engels. They analysed human existence, the relationship between human beings and nature and the ways in which production and the reproduction of the human species and the economy take place.

While asserting that ‚Äúlabour is the source of wealth and prime basic condition for human existence,‚Äù Marx and Engels analysed the dialectics of nature. They pointed out how the harmony among people, land, water and air leads to changes. In Capital, Marx explained that ‚Äúlabour is in the first place a process in which both man and nature participate‚Äù. Marx went on to explain that labour process was nothing but the production process. He showed how labour is the source of wealth and how labour power keeps producing surplus value. In the same work, he explained how under capitalism, surplus value is appropriated by capitalists, who are the owners of the means of production. He also explained how this appropriation of surplus value leads to accumulation of wealth at one pole and the pauperisation of the working people at another. Such inequality is reflected in the miserable working and living conditions of the working people.

While analysing the housing question of the society, especially how the bourgeoisie solves the housing question, Engels pointed out ‚Äúthe poor districts in which the workers are crowded together are the breeding places of all those epidemics which from time to time afflict out towns. Cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, smallpox and other ravaging diseases spared their germs in the pestilential air and the poisoned water of these working class quarters‚Äù. This explains why the poor and the migrant workers of all countries including India are facing unimaginable difficulties and becoming victims of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The developments in the past two decades have forced the capitalists to think of new deals and plans to perpetuate the exploitation of the working classes. Before COVID-19, the world capitalist economy faced a crisis in 2008, when the US economy was confronted with a subprime loan crisis. The current pandemic has pushed the world economic order on to a ventilator.

There are many who think that this pandemic is affecting all countries, all communities and all classes in the same way. Therefore, we should first allow the governments to handle it and then fight for our concerns. But that is not right. Capitalists are more clever. In the name of fighting the pandemic, capitalist governments are taking more control in their hands.

In India, the BJP-RSS combine is trying to push the country towards a theocratic fascist state. Left and secular democratic forces have intensified efforts to channelise the anger of the working people against this capitalist and fascist political order, which has put the lives of millions of common people at stake by denying them their rights.

The lies and failures of the government have to be exposed. Capitalism uses religion as a tool to make people fight each other but the millions of people will understand the heinous design of communal-fascist rulers, and not allow them to divide society further. When Marx looked at the Indian social structure, he understood the place of caste in it. His writings after the Taiping Rebellion in China, Sepoy Mutiny in India (India‚Äôs first war of independence) and Black Resistance in America made him talk about the urgent need of a democratic revolution in India. Marx‚Äôs term ‚Äúdemocratic revolution‚Äù holds possibilities for the abolition of the caste system.

In the philosophical pursuit for a new world, Marxism emerged as a revolutionary theory and science. The three integral components of Marxism, as Lenin pointed, out are one, the philosophy of dialectical materialism (historical materialism), two, the theory of surplus value and three, the doctrine of class struggle as the motive force of History.

The future is going to witness intense class struggles for political power so that a new social order emerges in which the state shall ensure housing, healthcare, education and all means of livelihood to all its citizens, and equality, justice and dignity of all citizens are upheld.

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Karl Marx on May 5 (1818) while paying tributes let the working people advance their struggle to overthrow the capitalist society and to liberate from the chains of oppression and exploitation.

(Express photo) Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT sent to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. (Express photo)

A BSF driver accompanying Centre‚Äôs Inter-Ministerial Central Team (ICMT) to West Bengal has tested positive for COVID-19. Following the development, 50 personnel from BSF‚Äôs Kolkata headquarters have been quarantined as the driver belonged to the force.

Two IMCTs had been sent by the Centre to West Bengal to monitor Covid-19 containment measures and lockdown implementation in the state and and send a report to the Centre.

Since the IMCTs initially did not get adequate cooperation from the state, they stayed at BSF guesthouse and used BSF vehicles . Sources said the infected driver was accompanying the IMCT as they moved around to take stock of the situation in Kolkata. This IMCT is headed by Apurva Chandra, Additional Secretary, Ministry of Defence.

The two IMCTs sent to West Bengal have given an unflattering report of the situation in the state and even said that the mortality rate among Covid-19 patients (12.8 per cent) is the highest in the state. The IMCT is now back in Delhi.

In contrast, the home ministry has claimed that the IMCTs sent to Gujarat have praised the efforts of the state government in fighting COVID-19. Ahmedabad and Surat are among the most severely affected cities in the state. It is not yet clear whether the MHA has asked the West Bengal IMCT members to go for testing or quarantine.

A BSF officer from Bengal said, ‚ÄúAlthough this driver was not in direct contact with the IMCT members and all drivers had been directed to stay put in their vehicles when the IMCT was out doing its work, we are tracing all contacts and taking necessary precautions.‚Äù

Meanwhile, the BSF Headquarters in Delhi have been sealed after a constable working in the office of an Additional DG-rank officer tested positive late Sunday night. The headquarters are being sanitised currently. Sources said the ADG is likely to be asked to go for testing.

This comes in the backdrop of 56 BSF personnel having tested positive so far. As many as 32 of these are suspected to have got the infection while discharging law and order duties with Delhi Police in Jama Masjid and Chandni Mahal areas.

Meanwhile, 15 personnel of the Sashatra Seema Bal, which guards the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border, have also tested positive in Delhi. They all belong to one battalion stationed at Ghitorni.

‚ÄúA head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on 3rd May 2020. He last attended office on Friday 1st May 2020. He was working in an office on the second floor of BSF Force Headquarters. All persons who came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution, ‚Äù a statement from the BSF said about latest developments.

It was only on Friday that BSF the had got its entire headquarter disinfected. ‚ÄúThe disinfection of complete Block 10 CGO complex BSF force headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today light of latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, ‚Äù BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bharadwaj said.

The developments come days after 135 CRPF personnel having tested positive at its Mayur Vihar camp.

(Representational Image) The swift action of Kerala government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. (Representational Image)

Written by Saikat Sinha Roy and M Suresh Babu

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate.

This comes in the backdrop of 56 BSF personnel having tested positive so far. As many as 32 of these are suspected to have got the infection while discharging law and order duties with Delhi Police in Jama Masjid and Chandni Mahal areas.

Meanwhile, 15 personnel of the Sashatra Seema Bal, which guards the Indo-Nepal and Indo-Bhutan border, have also tested positive in Delhi. They all belong to one battalion stationed at Ghitorni.

‚ÄúA head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on 3rd May 2020. He last attended office on Friday 1st May 2020. He was working in an office on the second floor of BSF Force Headquarters. All persons who came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution, ‚Äù a statement from the BSF said about latest developments.

It was only on Friday that BSF the had got its entire headquarter disinfected. ‚ÄúThe disinfection of complete Block 10 CGO complex BSF force headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today light of latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, ‚Äù BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bharadwaj said.

The developments come days after 135 CRPF personnel having tested positive at its Mayur Vihar camp.

Written by Saikat Sinha Roy and M Suresh Babu

The first case of COVID 19 in India surfaced in Kerala on January 31, 2020, imported from Wuhan. This provoked discussions on the negative spillover effects of international migration, which has been a feature of Kerala‚Äôs development trajectory in recent years. In early March, Kerala and Maharashtra were the leading states in terms of the positive COVID19 cases. The number of infected patients started to increase in Kerala until the end of March, as a section of international migrants started to return to the state.

The swift action of the state government in identifying the possible social contacts and subsequently tracing them started to show results by early April. This onerous task continued for a longer duration as more and more imported cases began to surface in an economy, which is driven to a large extent by the opportunities in global labour markets and international tourism. The sustained efforts started to yield results and by mid-April the state, which was second in total number of infected cases in mid-March, slipped to the 10th position and was well on its way to have a carefully drafted exit policy from the lockdown. This remarkable achievement of Kerala has now attracted international attention much like the famous ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô of development.

Kerala has a long history of social sector development, which predates the coinage of the ‚ÄòKerala Model of Development‚Äô in the 1970s. Kerala‚Äôs model has essentially emphasised on the development of health and education and thus laying a strong foundation for sustained long-run development. Not only did the state consciously develop government-funded primary health care and education but also allowed private participation in tertiary health care and education without losing the focus on the primary priorities. Successive governments in Kerala emphasised on universal literacy much ahead of the rest of the country, in tandem with making smart moves on seizing the opportunities provided by globalization. The underlying strategy was to realise the benefits that would accrue from globalisation, which will be possible if and only if there is a strong human resource base. Hence, health and education sector indicators continued to improve even after the state embraced policies towards globalisation. What becomes important in the context of ‚Äòflattening the curve‚Äô of spread of COVID 19, is this priority accorded to public health. Public health and hygiene issues have never taken a back seat even when the focus started drifting towards privatisation and efficiency in the health sector.

Apart from a well-laid health system throughout the state, the general level of awareness is high, especially among women due to high female literacy. On account of awareness, the reported morbidity in Kerala is always significantly higher than in the rest of the country and it is often argued out that morbidity among infants is high not necessarily as an indicator of ill health, but it is indicative of mother‚Äôs awareness. In case of COVID 19, with this combination of high level of awareness and a well functioning health sector, Kerala has been able to contain the possible rapid spread swiftly. This assumes significance as the state has a larger share of aging and migrant population. Eventually, both morbidity and mortality on account of COVID 19 has been much lower than in many developed countries. It is here that the human development achievements contributed, as the state is endowed with an army of skillful population and a large pool of medics and paramedics, who are integral to a well-functioning health sector. Kerala has thus created its own comparative advantage and is thus uniquely placed to deal with calamities much more adroitly.

What can the rest of the world learn from Kerala‚Äôs experience? Unarguably it is difficult to replicate the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô, as the rest have poorly invested in health and education, more so than the other states in India. However, the ‚ÄòKerala Model‚Äô offers some important insights. First, efficiently dealing with such a pandemic would require larger investments in social sector to create capacity and make the population aware of the gravity of the situation so that they are equipped to tackle it at their individual level. This is perhaps what is meant by Kerala‚Äôs ‚Äúpreparedness‚Äù to deal with the pandemic. Perhaps other states in India should swiftly increase their COVID-19 related expenditure manifold in order to flatten the rising curve. This higher expenditure is imperative due to their low base in social development, which demands much more effort now to reach the level that exists in Kerala. Perhaps the lockdown has given an opportunity to create capacity by instituting prudent policies for the health sector.

Second, there exists a dire necessity for having more public goods. The approach of WHO, ‚Äòtest, trace, isolate, treat‚Äô, which Kerala followed diligently, banks on the availability of public goods in the system. Markets fail in dealing with this sequential approach as each component is intertwined with the other. Global experience shows that shortage of public goods and the inability of markets to respond have been the two major reasons for loss of lives even in the advanced economies. Kerala could ramp up testing to 450 per million due to the capacity created in the public health system. A public good perspective in dealing with basic needs of the citizens is an important lesson that Kerala provides. A well-functioning public distribution system, which provides the much needed ‚Äòsafety net‚Äô to vulnerable sections of the population, bears testimony to this.

Third, the success of dealing with a crisis of this dimension lies in social mobilisation. Kerala could successfully quarantine the infected and deal with the issues of in-migrant workers simultaneously due to community participation. Much like the previous episodes of crisis, Kerala launched a campaign mode to mobilise people for a variety of activities ranging from ‚Äòbreak the chain‚Äô campaign to setting up community kitchens. The leadership was swift to realise the secondary effects of the lock down such as increased poverty and deprivation and counter it upfront due to the unstinted support of the community. Social mobilisation of this scale can only be possible with high levels of social development. Kerala‚Äôs experience underscores the need for sustained development policies and not short-term one-off interventions.

(AP/File) Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press. (AP/File)

US officials believe China covered up the extent of the coronavirus outbreak and how contagious the disease is to stock up on medical supplies needed to respond to it, intelligence documents show.

Chinese leaders intentionally concealed the severity of the pandemic from the world in early January, according to a four-page Department of Homeland Security intelligence report dated May 1 and obtained by The Associated Press.

READ | Coronavirus not ‚Äòmanmade or genetically modified‚Äô: US intelligence agencies

The revelation comes as the Trump administration has intensified its criticism of China, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo saying Sunday that that country was responsible for the spread of disease and must be held accountable.

The sharper rhetoric coincides with administration critics saying the government‚Äôs response to the virus was slow and inadequate. President Donald Trump‚Äôs political opponents have accused him of lashing out at China, a geopolitical foe but critical U.S. trade partner, in an attempt to deflect criticism at home.

Not classified but marked ?for official use only, the DHS analysis states that, while downplaying the severity of the coronavirus, China increased imports and decreased exports of medical supplies. It attempted to cover up doing so by denying there were export restrictions and obfuscating and delaying provision of its trade data, the analysis states.

The report also says China held off informing the World Health Organization that the coronavirus was a contagion for much of January so it could order medical supplies from abroad ? and that its imports of face masks and surgical gowns and gloves increased sharply.

Those conclusions are based on the 95% probability that China‚Äôs changes in imports and export behavior were not within normal range, according to the report. China informed the WHO of the outbreak on Dec. 31. It contacted the U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Jan. 3 and publicly identified the pathogen as a novel coronavirus on January 8.

Chinese officials muffled doctors who warned about the virus early on and repeatedly downplayed the threat of the outbreak. However, many of the Chinese government‚Äôs missteps appear to have been due to bureaucratic hurdles, tight controls on information, and officials hesitant to report bad news.

There is no public evidence to suggest it was an intentional plot to buy up the world‚Äôs medical supplies.

In a tweet on Sunday, the president appeared to blame US intelligence officials for not making clearer sooner just how dangerous a potential coronavirus outbreak could be. Trump has been defensive over whether he failed to act after receiving early warnings from intelligence officials and others about the coronavirus and its potential impact.

Intelligence has just reported to me that I was correct, and that they did NOT bring up the CoronaVirus subject matter until late into January, just prior to my banning China from the US, Trump wrote without citing specifics.

Also, they only spoke of the Virus in a very non-threatening, or matter of fact, manner.

Trump had previously speculated that China may have unleashed the coronavirus due to some kind of horrible mistake. His intelligence agencies say they are still examining a notion put forward by the president and aides that the pandemic may have resulted from an accident at a Chinese lab.

Speaking Sunday on ABC‚Äôs This Week, Pompeo said he had no reason to believe that the virus was deliberately spread. But he added, Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories. These are not the first times that we‚Äôve had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab, Pompeo said.

And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.

The secretary of state appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. His remark may be seen as offensive in China. Still, Pompeo repeated the same assertion hours later, via a tweet Sunday afternoon.

Experts say the virus arose naturally in bats, and make it clear that they believe it wasn‚Äôt man-made. Many virologists say the chance that the outbreak was caused by a lab accident is very low, though scientists are still working to determine a point at which it may have jumped from animals to humans.

Beijing has repeatedly pushed back on US accusations that the outbreak was China‚Äôs fault, pointing to many missteps made by American officials in their own fight against the outbreak.

China‚Äôs public announcement on Jan. 20 that the virus was transmissible from person to person left the US nearly two months to prepare for the pandemic, during which the US government failed to bolster medical supplies and deployed flawed testing kits.

The US government has ignored the facts, diverted public attention and engaged in buck-passing in an attempt to shirk its responsibility for incompetence in the fight against the epidemic, Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Geng Shuang said Friday.

With the help of science, humanity will eventually overcome the crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Many theories and philosophies will emerge. Many interpretations will be presented before the people and the governments. But the question is whether the post-COVID 19 world will be the same as before or will it change, whether the capitalist order will become more inhuman and exploitative. Thomas L Friedman has written that ‚ÄúCOVID-19 is a black elephant. It is the logical outcome of our increasingly destructive wars against nature‚Äù. The emerging situation is likely to be a matter of much public debate in which Karl Marx and Marxism will occupy centerstage.

‚ÄúAll philosophers have interpreted the world in various ways. However, the point is to change it‚Äù Marx wrote in Thesis on Feuerbach. This was the fundamental premise of the philosophical pursuit of Marx and his lifelong companion Friedrich Engels. They analysed human existence, the relationship between human beings and nature and the ways in which production and the reproduction of the human species and the economy take place.

While asserting that ‚Äúlabour is the source of wealth and prime basic condition for human existence,‚Äù Marx and Engels analysed the dialectics of nature. They pointed out how the harmony among people, land, water and air leads to changes. In Capital, Marx explained that ‚Äúlabour is in the first place a process in which both man and nature participate‚Äù. Marx went on to explain that labour process was nothing but the production process. He showed how labour is the source of wealth and how labour power keeps producing surplus value. In the same work, he explained how under capitalism, surplus value is appropriated by capitalists, who are the owners of the means of production. He also explained how this appropriation of surplus value leads to accumulation of wealth at one pole and the pauperisation of the working people at another. Such inequality is reflected in the miserable working and living conditions of the working people.

While analysing the housing question of the society, especially how the bourgeoisie solves the housing question, Engels pointed out ‚Äúthe poor districts in which the workers are crowded together are the breeding places of all those epidemics which from time to time afflict out towns. Cholera, typhus, typhoid fever, smallpox and other ravaging diseases spared their germs in the pestilential air and the poisoned water of these working class quarters‚Äù. This explains why the poor and the migrant workers of all countries including India are facing unimaginable difficulties and becoming victims of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The developments in the past two decades have forced the capitalists to think of new deals and plans to perpetuate the exploitation of the working classes. Before COVID-19, the world capitalist economy faced a crisis in 2008, when the US economy was confronted with a subprime loan crisis. The current pandemic has pushed the world economic order on to a ventilator.

There are many who think that this pandemic is affecting all countries, all communities and all classes in the same way. Therefore, we should first allow the governments to handle it and then fight for our concerns. But that is not right. Capitalists are more clever. In the name of fighting the pandemic, capitalist governments are taking more control in their hands.

In India, the BJP-RSS combine is trying to push the country towards a theocratic fascist state. Left and secular democratic forces have intensified efforts to channelise the anger of the working people against this capitalist and fascist political order, which has put the lives of millions of common people at stake by denying them their rights.

The lies and failures of the government have to be exposed. Capitalism uses religion as a tool to make people fight each other but the millions of people will understand the heinous design of communal-fascist rulers, and not allow them to divide society further. When Marx looked at the Indian social structure, he understood the place of caste in it. His writings after the Taiping Rebellion in China, Sepoy Mutiny in India (India‚Äôs first war of independence) and Black Resistance in America made him talk about the urgent need of a democratic revolution in India. Marx‚Äôs term ‚Äúdemocratic revolution‚Äù holds possibilities for the abolition of the caste system.

In the philosophical pursuit for a new world, Marxism emerged as a revolutionary theory and science. The three integral components of Marxism, as Lenin pointed, out are one, the philosophy of dialectical materialism (historical materialism), two, the theory of surplus value and three, the doctrine of class struggle as the motive force of History.

The future is going to witness intense class struggles for political power so that a new social order emerges in which the state shall ensure housing, healthcare, education and all means of livelihood to all its citizens, and equality, justice and dignity of all citizens are upheld.

On the occasion of the birth anniversary of Karl Marx on May 5 (1818) while paying tributes let the working people advance their struggle to overthrow the capitalist society and to liberate from the chains of oppression and exploitation.

""Prior to the detection of the case on Friday, as a special precautionary measure, BSF Force Headquarters was closed early by 4pm. All attending staff vacated offices and the entire office complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants. For Saturday and Sunday -- May 2 and 3, the Force Headquarters was closed. No staff other than the security personnel and the control room members in limited numbers worked in the headquarter,"" BSF said.



The disinfection of the complete BSF Headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today in light of the latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, BSF stated.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

‚ÄúAround four hospitals have been identified as trial sites and are waiting for ethics committee approval. We are also in the process of enrolling patients for the trial. Trials in India can start as soon as the drug arrives,‚Äù a senior official told TOI.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

Don't Miss

‚ÄúAround four hospitals have been identified as trial sites and are waiting for ethics committee approval. We are also in the process of enrolling patients for the trial. Trials in India can start as soon as the drug arrives,‚Äù a senior official told TOI.

However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

‚ÄúAround four hospitals have been identified as trial sites and are waiting for ethics committee approval. We are also in the process of enrolling patients for the trial. Trials in India can start as soon as the drug arrives,‚Äù a senior official told TOI.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The Border Security Force (BSF) on Monday decided to close its two floors after a staff tested COVID-19 positive.



""A head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on May 3. He last attended the office on Friday (May 1). He was working in the office on the second floor of BSF Headquarter. All persons came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution,"" BSF said.

The force headquarters was already closed as a special precautionary measure.

""Prior to the detection of the case on Friday, as a special precautionary measure, BSF Force Headquarters was closed early by 4pm. All attending staff vacated offices and the entire office complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants. For Saturday and Sunday -- May 2 and 3, the Force Headquarters was closed. No staff other than the security personnel and the control room members in limited numbers worked in the headquarter,"" BSF said.



The disinfection of the complete BSF Headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today in light of the latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, BSF stated.

Well, sort of.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The Border Security Force (BSF) on Monday decided to close its two floors after a staff tested COVID-19 positive.



""A head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on May 3. He last attended the office on Friday (May 1). He was working in the office on the second floor of BSF Headquarter. All persons came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution,"" BSF said.

The force headquarters was already closed as a special precautionary measure.

""Prior to the detection of the case on Friday, as a special precautionary measure, BSF Force Headquarters was closed early by 4pm. All attending staff vacated offices and the entire office complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants. For Saturday and Sunday -- May 2 and 3, the Force Headquarters was closed. No staff other than the security personnel and the control room members in limited numbers worked in the headquarter,"" BSF said.



The disinfection of the complete BSF Headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today in light of the latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, BSF stated.

Well, sort of.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The Border Security Force (BSF) on Monday decided to close its two floors after a staff tested COVID-19 positive.



""A head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on May 3. He last attended the office on Friday (May 1). He was working in the office on the second floor of BSF Headquarter. All persons came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution,"" BSF said.

The force headquarters was already closed as a special precautionary measure.

""Prior to the detection of the case on Friday, as a special precautionary measure, BSF Force Headquarters was closed early by 4pm. All attending staff vacated offices and the entire office complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants. For Saturday and Sunday -- May 2 and 3, the Force Headquarters was closed. No staff other than the security personnel and the control room members in limited numbers worked in the headquarter,"" BSF said.



The disinfection of the complete BSF Headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today in light of the latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, BSF stated.

Well, sort of.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The Border Security Force (BSF) on Monday decided to close its two floors after a staff tested COVID-19 positive.



""A head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on May 3. He last attended the office on Friday (May 1). He was working in the office on the second floor of BSF Headquarter. All persons came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution,"" BSF said.

The force headquarters was already closed as a special precautionary measure.

""Prior to the detection of the case on Friday, as a special precautionary measure, BSF Force Headquarters was closed early by 4pm. All attending staff vacated offices and the entire office complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants. For Saturday and Sunday -- May 2 and 3, the Force Headquarters was closed. No staff other than the security personnel and the control room members in limited numbers worked in the headquarter,"" BSF said.



The disinfection of the complete BSF Headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today in light of the latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, BSF stated.

Well, sort of.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The Border Security Force (BSF) on Monday decided to close its two floors after a staff tested COVID-19 positive.



""A head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on May 3. He last attended the office on Friday (May 1). He was working in the office on the second floor of BSF Headquarter. All persons came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution,"" BSF said.

The force headquarters was already closed as a special precautionary measure.

""Prior to the detection of the case on Friday, as a special precautionary measure, BSF Force Headquarters was closed early by 4pm. All attending staff vacated offices and the entire office complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants. For Saturday and Sunday -- May 2 and 3, the Force Headquarters was closed. No staff other than the security personnel and the control room members in limited numbers worked in the headquarter,"" BSF said.



The disinfection of the complete BSF Headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today in light of the latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, BSF stated.

Well, sort of.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The Border Security Force (BSF) on Monday decided to close its two floors after a staff tested COVID-19 positive.



""A head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on May 3. He last attended the office on Friday (May 1). He was working in the office on the second floor of BSF Headquarter. All persons came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution,"" BSF said.

The force headquarters was already closed as a special precautionary measure.

""Prior to the detection of the case on Friday, as a special precautionary measure, BSF Force Headquarters was closed early by 4pm. All attending staff vacated offices and the entire office complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants. For Saturday and Sunday -- May 2 and 3, the Force Headquarters was closed. No staff other than the security personnel and the control room members in limited numbers worked in the headquarter,"" BSF said.



The disinfection of the complete BSF Headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today in light of the latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, BSF stated.

The jawan was tested positive on Sunday. He has now been admitted to an isolation facility of the state government.

Over 50 personnel who were in touch with the infected BSF jawan have been quarantined and about 20 have been tested till now and their reports are awaited. Kolkata is the headquarters for the south Bengal frontier of the BSF that guards over 930 km of the India-Bangladesh border."

Well, sort of.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The Border Security Force (BSF) on Monday decided to close its two floors after a staff tested COVID-19 positive.



""A head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on May 3. He last attended the office on Friday (May 1). He was working in the office on the second floor of BSF Headquarter. All persons came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution,"" BSF said.

The force headquarters was already closed as a special precautionary measure.

""Prior to the detection of the case on Friday, as a special precautionary measure, BSF Force Headquarters was closed early by 4pm. All attending staff vacated offices and the entire office complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants. For Saturday and Sunday -- May 2 and 3, the Force Headquarters was closed. No staff other than the security personnel and the control room members in limited numbers worked in the headquarter,"" BSF said.



The disinfection of the complete BSF Headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today in light of the latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, BSF stated.

Well, sort of.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The Border Security Force (BSF) on Monday decided to close its two floors after a staff tested COVID-19 positive.



""A head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on May 3. He last attended the office on Friday (May 1). He was working in the office on the second floor of BSF Headquarter. All persons came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution,"" BSF said.

The force headquarters was already closed as a special precautionary measure.

""Prior to the detection of the case on Friday, as a special precautionary measure, BSF Force Headquarters was closed early by 4pm. All attending staff vacated offices and the entire office complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants. For Saturday and Sunday -- May 2 and 3, the Force Headquarters was closed. No staff other than the security personnel and the control room members in limited numbers worked in the headquarter,"" BSF said.



The disinfection of the complete BSF Headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today in light of the latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, BSF stated.

The jawan was tested positive on Sunday. He has now been admitted to an isolation facility of the state government.

Over 50 personnel who were in touch with the infected BSF jawan have been quarantined and about 20 have been tested till now and their reports are awaited. Kolkata is the headquarters for the south Bengal frontier of the BSF that guards over 930 km of the India-Bangladesh border."

Well, sort of.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The Border Security Force (BSF) on Monday decided to close its two floors after a staff tested COVID-19 positive.



""A head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on May 3. He last attended the office on Friday (May 1). He was working in the office on the second floor of BSF Headquarter. All persons came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution,"" BSF said.

The force headquarters was already closed as a special precautionary measure.

""Prior to the detection of the case on Friday, as a special precautionary measure, BSF Force Headquarters was closed early by 4pm. All attending staff vacated offices and the entire office complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants. For Saturday and Sunday -- May 2 and 3, the Force Headquarters was closed. No staff other than the security personnel and the control room members in limited numbers worked in the headquarter,"" BSF said.



The disinfection of the complete BSF Headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today in light of the latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, BSF stated.

Well, sort of.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The Border Security Force (BSF) on Monday decided to close its two floors after a staff tested COVID-19 positive.



""A head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on May 3. He last attended the office on Friday (May 1). He was working in the office on the second floor of BSF Headquarter. All persons came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution,"" BSF said.

The force headquarters was already closed as a special precautionary measure.

""Prior to the detection of the case on Friday, as a special precautionary measure, BSF Force Headquarters was closed early by 4pm. All attending staff vacated offices and the entire office complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants. For Saturday and Sunday -- May 2 and 3, the Force Headquarters was closed. No staff other than the security personnel and the control room members in limited numbers worked in the headquarter,"" BSF said.



The disinfection of the complete BSF Headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today in light of the latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, BSF stated.

Well, sort of.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The Border Security Force (BSF) on Monday decided to close its two floors after a staff tested COVID-19 positive.



""A head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on May 3. He last attended the office on Friday (May 1). He was working in the office on the second floor of BSF Headquarter. All persons came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution,"" BSF said.

The force headquarters was already closed as a special precautionary measure.

""Prior to the detection of the case on Friday, as a special precautionary measure, BSF Force Headquarters was closed early by 4pm. All attending staff vacated offices and the entire office complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants. For Saturday and Sunday -- May 2 and 3, the Force Headquarters was closed. No staff other than the security personnel and the control room members in limited numbers worked in the headquarter,"" BSF said.



The disinfection of the complete BSF Headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today in light of the latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, BSF stated.

Well, sort of.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The Border Security Force (BSF) on Monday decided to close its two floors after a staff tested COVID-19 positive.



""A head constable of BSF working in BSF Force Headquarters Block 10 CGO complex, has been found COVID-19 positive late night on May 3. He last attended the office on Friday (May 1). He was working in the office on the second floor of BSF Headquarter. All persons came in his contact have been identified and quarantined. They will also be tested for COVID 19. Offices on first and second floors of FHQ have been closed as a precaution,"" BSF said.

The force headquarters was already closed as a special precautionary measure.

""Prior to the detection of the case on Friday, as a special precautionary measure, BSF Force Headquarters was closed early by 4pm. All attending staff vacated offices and the entire office complex was thoroughly sanitised with prescribed solutions of disinfectants. For Saturday and Sunday -- May 2 and 3, the Force Headquarters was closed. No staff other than the security personnel and the control room members in limited numbers worked in the headquarter,"" BSF said.



The disinfection of the complete BSF Headquarters will be done again in the afternoon today in light of the latest COVID-19 positive case. Identification of secondary and tertiary contacts as per protocol is being carried out. All protocols are being followed, BSF stated.

Well, sort of.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Reuters

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

The US FDA has allowed the emergency use of experimental antiviral drug ‚ÄòRemdesivir‚Äô to treat COVID-19 patients after early clinical data showed that it is helping COVID-19 patients to recover faster.



The medicine is manufactured by Gilead Sciences and is regarded as the first drug approved to treat COVID-19 patients. This authorisation now allows the intravenous drug to be given to doctors who are advised to administer it to patients with severe case of COVID-19, particularly involving low blood oxygen levels or those who are dependent on ventilators for breathing.

The medicine was actually developed to treat Ebola. However, it has been used in experiments to treat coronaviruses MERS and SARS, that hinted its efficacy towards COVID-19.

Remdesivir is 31 percent effective in treating COVID-19

Remdesivir has shown promise in animal models previously. However, the most recent study conducted by the National Institutes of Health revealed that people who were put on remdesivir recovered 31 percent faster than those who were prescribed a placebo. Another study conducted internally by Gilead revealed that the drug was equally effective over five days of use as it is over 10.

According to Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, ‚ÄúThis is really quite important. This will be the standard of care.‚Äù

Gilead has also announced that is donating its entire supply of 1.5 million doses of remdesivir to the US government, which will help treat 140,000 patients based on a 10-day treatment cycle.



However, not all tests are showing that it‚Äôs going to be effective. A randomised trial of the drug (published in lancelet) showed no betterment in the healing of the patients. More tests are crucial to strengthen its efficacy claims.

Remdesivir trials in India to begin soon

Gilead has announced that it wants to expand its trials to many countries but it has stated that it will be excluding India from this list as the supply is limited.

However, recently. Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has revealed that it has received 1000 samples of remdesivir and will be testing it on patients soon, as a part of WHO‚Äôs solidarity trial, according to a News18 report.

https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

It added that it has donated one lakh N95 and 65,000 Personal Protective Equipment masks to hospitals for use by frontline health workers such as doctors and hospital staff. In addition, over 40,000 basic hygiene kits that include 3 ply masks, soaps and hand sanitizers have been donated to prevent the spread of the virus in local communities.

The workers were sent after a medical checkup and all other precautionary measures were being followed to contain the spread of coronavirus, the official told reporters here.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The Maharashtra government is in touch with other states before planning to send back the migrant labourers to their native places, he said.

""We are taking all precautions before allowing the migrant labourers to board trains. It is difficult for us to detect those who are infected by coronavirus but are asymptomatic. We can't do anything more than their primary health checkup,"" the official said.

Asked about private vehicles being allowed to transport migrant labourers to their respective states, he said, Except Rajasthan, no other state has shown willingness to allow migrant labourers to travel by bus and private vehicles."""
https://www.deccanherald.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/fight-against-coronavirus-not-victims-says-sonali-kulkarni-833410.html,"‚ÄúThe fight is against Corona, not its victims,"" appealled actor Sonali Kulkarni. The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

It, however, did not specifiy when the MFIs would resume operations.

The lenders have also agreed to extend the three-month moratorium provided by the RBI on term loans to borrowers, the statement said, adding, collections will be made only from customers who have opted out of it.

Demand for micro-finance will increase once MFIs start full-fledged operations after the lockdown is lifted, th MFIN said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/international/europe-stirs-back-to-life-as-coronavirus-lockdowns-ease-833400.html,"Workers banged away at construction sites in Rome, police handed out masks in Madrid and older children returned to school in Vienna as Europe on Monday gingerly stepped Monday out of its coronavirus lockdown.

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this.

https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far.

So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest.

Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The workers were sent after a medical checkup and all other precautionary measures were being followed to contain the spread of coronavirus, the official told reporters here.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

The country tries to make sense of the various zones in an attempt to get back to some normalcy and we take a look at what it costs to treat a Covid-19 patient.

On the bulletin today...Karnataka reports 12 new cases and 3 deaths‚Ä¶ some details emerge regarding the lockdown guidelines issued yesterday...and a look at what Karnataka spends in treating Covid-19 patients... And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

The country tries to make sense of the various zones in an attempt to get back to some normalcy and we take a look at what it costs to treat a Covid-19 patient. All this and more on the daily update with Akhil Kadidal and Surksha Pinnu. Links: NRAI: https://r4r.nrai.org/ --- Full Text: This the daily Covid update from Deccan Herald. On the bulletin today...Karnataka reports 12 new cases and 3 deaths‚Ä¶ some details emerge regarding the lockdown guidelines issued yesterday...and a look at what Karnataka spends in treating Covid-19 patients... And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

On the bulletin today...Karnataka reports 12 new cases and 3 deaths‚Ä¶ some details emerge regarding the lockdown guidelines issued yesterday...and a look at what Karnataka spends in treating Covid-19 patients... And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The workers were sent after a medical checkup and all other precautionary measures were being followed to contain the spread of coronavirus, the official told reporters here.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The workers were sent after a medical checkup and all other precautionary measures were being followed to contain the spread of coronavirus, the official told reporters here.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The Maharashtra government is in touch with other states before planning to send back the migrant labourers to their native places, he said.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones.

Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days.

The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate.

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now.

So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest.

Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

The country tries to make sense of the various zones in an attempt to get back to some normalcy and we take a look at what it costs to treat a Covid-19 patient. All this and more on the daily update with Akhil Kadidal and Surksha Pinnu. Links: NRAI: https://r4r.nrai.org/ --- Full Text: This the daily Covid update from Deccan Herald. On the bulletin today...Karnataka reports 12 new cases and 3 deaths‚Ä¶ some details emerge regarding the lockdown guidelines issued yesterday...and a look at what Karnataka spends in treating Covid-19 patients... And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown.

Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

On the bulletin today...Karnataka reports 12 new cases and 3 deaths‚Ä¶ some details emerge regarding the lockdown guidelines issued yesterday...and a look at what Karnataka spends in treating Covid-19 patients... And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The workers were sent after a medical checkup and all other precautionary measures were being followed to contain the spread of coronavirus, the official told reporters here.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The workers were sent after a medical checkup and all other precautionary measures were being followed to contain the spread of coronavirus, the official told reporters here.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The Maharashtra government is in touch with other states before planning to send back the migrant labourers to their native places, he said.

""We are taking all precautions before allowing the migrant labourers to board trains. It is difficult for us to detect those who are infected by coronavirus but are asymptomatic. We can't do anything more than their primary health checkup,"" the official said.

https://www.deccanherald.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/fight-against-coronavirus-not-victims-says-sonali-kulkarni-833410.html,"‚ÄúThe fight is against Corona, not its victims,"" appealled actor Sonali Kulkarni. The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17.

Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals.

https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The workers were sent after a medical checkup and all other precautionary measures were being followed to contain the spread of coronavirus, the official told reporters here.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The Maharashtra government is in touch with other states before planning to send back the migrant labourers to their native places, he said.

""We are taking all precautions before allowing the migrant labourers to board trains. It is difficult for us to detect those who are infected by coronavirus but are asymptomatic. We can't do anything more than their primary health checkup,"" the official said.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

On the bulletin today...Karnataka reports 12 new cases and 3 deaths‚Ä¶ some details emerge regarding the lockdown guidelines issued yesterday...and a look at what Karnataka spends in treating Covid-19 patients... And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The workers were sent after a medical checkup and all other precautionary measures were being followed to contain the spread of coronavirus, the official told reporters here.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The Maharashtra government is in touch with other states before planning to send back the migrant labourers to their native places, he said.

""We are taking all precautions before allowing the migrant labourers to board trains. It is difficult for us to detect those who are infected by coronavirus but are asymptomatic. We can't do anything more than their primary health checkup,"" the official said.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

The country tries to make sense of the various zones in an attempt to get back to some normalcy and we take a look at what it costs to treat a Covid-19 patient. All this and more on the daily update with Akhil Kadidal and Surksha Pinnu. Links: NRAI: https://r4r.nrai.org/ --- Full Text: This the daily Covid update from Deccan Herald. On the bulletin today...Karnataka reports 12 new cases and 3 deaths‚Ä¶ some details emerge regarding the lockdown guidelines issued yesterday...and a look at what Karnataka spends in treating Covid-19 patients... And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown.

So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The Maharashtra government is in touch with other states before planning to send back the migrant labourers to their native places, he said.

""We are taking all precautions before allowing the migrant labourers to board trains. It is difficult for us to detect those who are infected by coronavirus but are asymptomatic. We can't do anything more than their primary health checkup,"" the official said.

Asked about private vehicles being allowed to transport migrant labourers to their respective states, he said, Except Rajasthan, no other state has shown willingness to allow migrant labourers to travel by bus and private vehicles."""

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

The country tries to make sense of the various zones in an attempt to get back to some normalcy and we take a look at what it costs to treat a Covid-19 patient.

On the bulletin today...Karnataka reports 12 new cases and 3 deaths‚Ä¶ some details emerge regarding the lockdown guidelines issued yesterday...and a look at what Karnataka spends in treating Covid-19 patients... And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far.

So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest.

Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark.

Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The workers were sent after a medical checkup and all other precautionary measures were being followed to contain the spread of coronavirus, the official told reporters here.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The Maharashtra government is in touch with other states before planning to send back the migrant labourers to their native places, he said.

""We are taking all precautions before allowing the migrant labourers to board trains. It is difficult for us to detect those who are infected by coronavirus but are asymptomatic. We can't do anything more than their primary health checkup,"" the official said.

https://www.deccanherald.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/fight-against-coronavirus-not-victims-says-sonali-kulkarni-833410.html,"‚ÄúThe fight is against Corona, not its victims,"" appealled actor Sonali Kulkarni. The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far.

So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this.

https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The workers were sent after a medical checkup and all other precautionary measures were being followed to contain the spread of coronavirus, the official told reporters here.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The Maharashtra government is in touch with other states before planning to send back the migrant labourers to their native places, he said.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

The country tries to make sense of the various zones in an attempt to get back to some normalcy and we take a look at what it costs to treat a Covid-19 patient.

On the bulletin today...Karnataka reports 12 new cases and 3 deaths‚Ä¶ some details emerge regarding the lockdown guidelines issued yesterday...and a look at what Karnataka spends in treating Covid-19 patients... And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark.

So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

The country tries to make sense of the various zones in an attempt to get back to some normalcy and we take a look at what it costs to treat a Covid-19 patient. All this and more on the daily update with Akhil Kadidal and Surksha Pinnu. Links: NRAI: https://r4r.nrai.org/ --- Full Text: This the daily Covid update from Deccan Herald. On the bulletin today...Karnataka reports 12 new cases and 3 deaths‚Ä¶ some details emerge regarding the lockdown guidelines issued yesterday...and a look at what Karnataka spends in treating Covid-19 patients... And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

On the bulletin today...Karnataka reports 12 new cases and 3 deaths‚Ä¶ some details emerge regarding the lockdown guidelines issued yesterday...and a look at what Karnataka spends in treating Covid-19 patients... And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The workers were sent after a medical checkup and all other precautionary measures were being followed to contain the spread of coronavirus, the official told reporters here.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The Maharashtra government is in touch with other states before planning to send back the migrant labourers to their native places, he said.

""We are taking all precautions before allowing the migrant labourers to board trains. It is difficult for us to detect those who are infected by coronavirus but are asymptomatic. We can't do anything more than their primary health checkup,"" the official said.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The workers were sent after a medical checkup and all other precautionary measures were being followed to contain the spread of coronavirus, the official told reporters here.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The Maharashtra government is in touch with other states before planning to send back the migrant labourers to their native places, he said.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this.

Karnataka is in touch with the Indian Railways to arrange for train services for those stranded in the state due to the lockdown to return to their native states.

The government has estimated 1.5 lakh people from other states are stranded in Karnataka due to the lockdown.

‚ÄúThe Railways has indicated that five rakes will be made available mostly for migrant labourers of Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan,‚Äù State Nodal Officer N Manjunath Prasad told DH. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting the willingness of people who want to go.‚Äù

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

All persons have to pay for their travel.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points. All returnees will be compulsorily registered and assessed by the health authorities. After entry, they will be kept under watch with periodic health checkups.

Migrant workers who are not computer-literate will be helped to apply online. ""We have nodal officers for each camp where these migrant workers are staying. The nodal officers will collect the applications manually filled up by the migrant workers and they will be uploaded,"" Prasad said."
https://www.deccanherald.com/national/south/mild-coronavirus-patients-to-move-to-treatment-centers-as-chennai-hospitals-run-short-of-beds-833402.html,"With all four designated COVID-19 government hospitals in Chennai filling up fast due to increasing number of positive cases, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) will shift mild and asymptomatic patients sans co-morbid conditions to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù that are being set up by converting convention halls and college hostels.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones.

Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days.

The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate.

All online applications will be sorted state-wise. Once the receiving state concurs, permission to travel will be given. All persons seeking permission to leave Karnataka will be screened by the health authorities.

Karnataka will arrange for buses, which will be sanitized and where social distancing will be maintained. Those who opt for train travel will be dropped off in buses at the railway station.

Only asymptomatic people are allowed to undertake travel back into Karnataka. They will be medically screened before being allowed to travel.

Each district will have only one entry point, which may be different from from the exit point to avoid people getting mixed up.

A checkpost with facilities for screening, medical checkup, water supply, food, temporary shelter and adequate toilet facilities will be set up near all entry points.

This is to ensure COVID-19 patients, who are symptomatic, critical and possess other health complications, have enough beds to get treated at these hospitals that are equipped to deal with any kind of exigencies. Also, the move would help ease crowding at government hospitals.

More than 70 per cent of beds in four COVID-19 hospitals ‚Äì Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Kilpauk Medical College Hospital (KMCH), Stanley Medical College Hospital (SMCH) and Government Omandurar Medical College Hospital (GOMCH) ‚Äì are already full and the remaining are also filing fast.

While the GOMCH has 500 beds, the remaining three medical college hospitals have 400 beds each, making it a total of 1,700. The city has been witnessing a massive spurt in the number of COVID-19 cases in the past one week ‚Äì as of Monday morning, the city had a total of 1,458 patients of whom 1,210 are active coronavirus cases.

‚ÄúThese are not just quarantine or isolation centres. These are treatment centres. Patients who are asymptomatic and less prone to complications will be moved to the treatment centres that will have all basic facilities required for them. Besides doctors, paramedics will also be available at these centres,‚Äù Dr M Jagadeesan, Chennai City Health Officer, told DH.

While a 600-bedded treatment facility at the Chennai Trade Centre and two other centres at educational institutions are ready to receive patients, Jagadeesan said more such centres are being set up across the city.

P Kumaravel Pandian, Deputy Commissioner (Works), GCC, told DH that 3,000 beds are ready at present and the civic body was ‚Äúworking silently‚Äù in converting more buildings into ‚Äútreatment centres.‚Äù

All the four government hospitals in the city have been asked to prepare a list of patients who can be moved to ‚Äútreatment and quarantine‚Äù centres that have been set up by converting hostels and convention halls.

Dr R Jayanti, Dean of RGGGH said patients who are asymptomatic and whose X-ray is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù will be shifted from hospitals to such centres.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now.

So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest.

Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

‚ÄúWe have already identified asymptomatic patients who are under the age of 50 without any co-morbid conditions and who can be shifted to these treatment centres. This is being done to ensure symptomatic patients who need more medical care can be admitted to the hospital,‚Äù she told DH.

She expressed the hope that such patients will be moved to ‚Äútreatment centres‚Äù in the next few days. KMCH dean Dr P Vasanthamani also spoke on similar lines, saying the hospital will move young asymptomatic patients at separate facilities earmarked by the GCC.

‚ÄúThere will be a shortage of beds if the situation continues to be like this. The GCC has identified 3 institutions where we can shift asymptomatic and stable patients. We will shift them to these centres where they will be taken care by doctors, paramedics and will be given the same treatment like in hospitals,‚Äù Dr Vasanthamani told DH.

Kumaravel Pandian said the GCC was in the process of converting hostels in institutions and convention halls into treatment and quarantine centres. ‚ÄúWe are well prepared to handle any kind of situation. We have 3,000 beds ready for now and more are being readied. There is no need to panic,‚Äù he said."

The workers were sent after a medical checkup and all other precautionary measures were being followed to contain the spread of coronavirus, the official told reporters here.

""So far, we have sent 35,000 migrant labourers back to their native states. We are sending more people after checking. Every labourer has to undergo a primary medical checkup before being eligible to travel,"" he said.

The Maharashtra government is in touch with other states before planning to send back the migrant labourers to their native places, he said.

""We are taking all precautions before allowing the migrant labourers to board trains. It is difficult for us to detect those who are infected by coronavirus but are asymptomatic. We can't do anything more than their primary health checkup,"" the official said.

The noted actor, known for lending support to social causes, has raised her voice against the apparent discrimination against COVID-19 positive patients across Maharashtra, through a video titled Vicharbadla.

There have been rising cases of COVID-19 positive or even suspected patients facing discrimination. Recently in Mumbai‚Äôs Lalbaug area, a 24-year-old photo-journalist working with a Marathi newspaper was ostracised and verbally abused by his neighbours after he returned home from institutional isolation.

The photo-journalist had not even tested positive, however, since he was in close contact with two other photo-journalists, who had tested positive, the BMC identified him as their high-risk contact and asked him to go to an isolation centre on April 20.

COVID-19 positive patients are also facing issues like their videos being circulated or their names being shared on whatsapp groups. Health professionals, including mental health experts, are increasingly expressing concerns over the long-term psychological impact of this on patients and their family.

Even Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has been urging people to show support towards the COVID-19 patients as well as their families instead of stigmatising them.

The 70-second video has been released by Mumbai based Waatavaran Foundation, and Jhatkaa.org who are working together in Maharashtra to create public awareness on COVID-19.

The film has been conceptualised and executed by Goregaon based Geeta Singh and Avinash Kumar Singh of Turtle on Hammock Films. Through this video, popular actor Sonali Kulkarni is seen encouraging and urging people to treat those suffering from COVID-19 with dignity and respecting their privacy.

‚ÄúThe unfortunate fact is that being COVID-19 positive seems nothing less than a crime as people think that if a person is tested positive for COVID-19, the person is a criminal. This is wrong and this mentality needs to change,‚Äù says Sonali Kulkarni in the video.

‚ÄúOur fight is against the pandemic, not the people suffering from it,‚Äù appeals Kulkarni. Kulkarni concludeD by appealing to the public that, ""let's not shake hands, instead let's shake off all the myths and stigma that is associated with being COVID-19 positive""."

With their death and infection rates slowing and their economies in ruins, some of Europe's biggest countries decided it was time to test whether something resembling the old way of life can resume.

""It appears that the initial wave of transmissions has passed its peak,"" Andrea Ammon, the director of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, told the European Parliament.

Yet it was a much more sombre and cautious Europe than the one that existed before entire nations shut down to ward off an illness that has now officially claimed more than 245,000 lives worldwide.

The piercing sounds of hammer drills echoed across a radiantly sunny Rome as 4.4 million blue collar workers -- an estimated 72 percent of them men -- picked up their tools again.

""We can hear more noise now,"" Rome grocery story owner Daniela observed. ""It's better than this frightening silence.""

The big excitement across the country of 60 million was that people were finally free to take strolls in parks and visit relatives for the first time in nine weeks.

In Milan, Italy's once-buzzing fashion and finance capital, workers in overalls sprayed down commuter trains with disinfectant.

Red round stickers with white outlines of footprints showed commuters where the could stand on platforms and in train cars while respecting the new social distancing rules.

Restaurants that had been shuttered since March 12 were doing basic cleanups as they prepared to resume takeout service.

""We are feeling a mix of joy and fear,"" 40-year-old Stefano Milano said in Rome, summarising the mood of many in Italy and across Europe.

]

The leaders of Spain, whose lockdown rivalled Italy's for its length and strictness, apologised to the country's children last week for confining them to their homes since mid-March.

Spanish kids reclaimed the streets after six weeks on April 26, and everyone was allowed to start going out and getting some exercise on Saturday.

Small shops, including hairdressers, began receiving clients by individual appointments Monday, and bars and restaurants were allowed to resume takeout service.

But the streets remained deserted, and police distributed free -- and mandatory -- face masks to the few commuters passing through the turnstiles of the Madrid metro.

""We are all afraid,"" Cristina Jimenez, 31, said while exiting Madrid's Sol metro station, her mask and rubber gloves on.

""Who hasn't lost their job already may lose it in the next few months,"" she said.

""But what is important is that we are well. With work, you can always find another.""

""We have a lot of appointments for today -- actually, for the whole week,"" said Ramazan Uzun, a 27-year-old barber in Berlin whose business was allowed to reopen on Monday.

But Uzun said he did not necessarily agree with the easing of restrictions, which has allowed museums, places of worship, playgrounds and zoos to reopen as well.

Some of Germany's smaller shops were back open for business on April 20.

""I live with my parents, who are old, and it would be good to be able to go home without having to worry.""

High schools reopened across the central European country, but only to allow the most senior students prepare for this month's graduation exams.

Lea Karner, her face largely hidden by a cloth mask, was thrilled.

""I am really happy because I can see my friends again, and I can just concentrate a lot better at school than I can at home,"" she said, visibly giddy in the sunshine.

""And I am happy to see my teachers again.""

Karner said she had to fight her mum and little brother for access to the family's only laptop.

""It was very tiring,"" she sighed.

The front doors of city buses were locked and the front rows chained off to protect drivers from infections as some commuters in Brussels returned to their offices for the first time.

But few people dared to venture out in a country with one of the world's highest per capita death rates from the virus. Those who did take buses and trains wore mandatory masks.

""I am happy to be able to leave my house again,"" Jean-Baptiste Bernard, a 27-year-old architect, said as he stepped out of the Schuman metro station.

He said this was the first time out since March 18.

""I am fed up with confinement,"" he admitted, calling working from home an ""intense"" experience he would rather do without.

While most offices across Belgium are now working, the country's shops will not reopen until May 11.

""I never imagined that such a small thing could bring so much pleasure."" Nebojsa Marovic, a 42-year-old musician, said while soaking up the sun on the terrace of his favourite Belgrade cafe.

Serbia reopened its restaurants, while its Balkan neighbour Croatia gave the green light to businesses involving close contact with clients, such as barber shops.

Slovenia also largely returned to business, although face masks were mandatory in public places across all three countries.

""I now realise that it is these little things we too often take for granted that really make life so precious,"" Marovic said.

Alexis Protopappas admitted that he was tired of looking ""like a bear"" as he popped into an Athens barber shop, which was allowed to reopen along with bookstores and a few other businesses.

""I look forward to going out and resuming my social life,"" he said.

But only about a tenth of all businesses were reopening Monday.

""Those who are out working today are mostly exhausted by the confinement,"" electric equipment store owner Nikos Kontos said."

On the bulletin today...Karnataka reports 12 new cases and 3 deaths‚Ä¶ some details emerge regarding the lockdown guidelines issued yesterday...and a look at what Karnataka spends in treating Covid-19 patients... And Nitin looks at the latest fake news...But first, a look at the national numbers. --- At the time of this recording nearly 2000 fresh cases have been reported from across the country today. Over 27,000 people are active carriers of the virus. More than 10,000 patients have recovered since they were first tested and...The country has registered 1,031 covid-related deaths so far. More than 39,000 cases have been reported from across India till date. --- The Indian Council of Medical Research has collected more than 9 lakh samples for testing from across the country since the first case was reported. --- A quick look at some of the state numbers now. Maharashtra continues to report the most number of Covid-19 cases in the country, the state reported 790 fresh cases today, and is fast approaching 10,000 active cases. 333 fresh cases have come in from Gujarat, pushing the number of active cases to the 4000 mark. Punjab registered 187 new cases today, and if you remember, it was one of the first states to extend the lockdown. Tamil Nadu has 231 new cases today and has the highest number of active cases among the Southern Indian states. Karnataka is in the 12th spot with 304 active cases. --- The state has reported 12 new cases today. So far 601 positive cases have been reported, out of which 304 cases are still active. 7 patients are in the ICU and 271 patients have been discharged so far. The state saw 3 deaths in the last 24 hours. --- All three deceased are in the 60 to 85 age group. Patient 556, a 69 year old man from Davengere with a past history of Diabetes and heart disease, who had been admitted due to SARI, died last night due to cardiac arrest. --- Patient 590, an 82 year old man from Bidar, who had been admitted due to SARI died on April 28th, his sample was found positive for Covid-19. --- Patient 557, a 63 year old man from Bengaluru Urban, who was also on chemotherapy died due to cardiac arrest. He is the first cancer patient to have succumbed to Covid-19 in the state. --- Among the 12 new cases reported today, 4 are from Bengaluru Urban. Of these, 3 are contacts of Patient 565, who had tested positive on April 30th after a complaint of Influenza Like Illness. Two cases have been reported from Tumakuru and Vijayapura. Belagavi, Bagalkote, Chikkaballapura and Bidar have reported once each. Except for a case of SARI from Bidar, all others are contacts of previously diagnosed patients. --- In national news, there is some more clarity regarding the new guidelines released as part of the Lockdown extension. According to the guidelines, marriages and funerals are permitted in non-containment zones. However, not more than 50 guests are permitted in case of a wedding, and 20 in the event of a funeral. --- E-commerce commerce companies are now permitted to deliver non-essential items like laptops, books and electrical appliances in green and orange zones from May 4, while only essential items will be delivered in red zones. There will be no delivery by e-commerce firms in any containment zones. All employees in public and private sectors attending work from May 4 will have to compulsorily download 'Aarogya Setu' app that helps in identifying the possibility of contracting Covid-19, according to the new guidelines. ---- Private offices can resume functioning in all zones, except containment zones from May 4th, but with 33% strength. Activists have raised concerns about security of the app as well as privacy concerns as they say that the app deviates from the international best practices of contact tracing apps and fails to comply with data protection standards. --- Domestic helps can now go back to work across the country, but the authorities have left it to the Resident Welfare Associations to take the final call.This has heightened the vulnerability of domestic workers across the country, who are denied wages in a large number of cases for April as many could not attend work due to lockdown. --- The Ministry of Civil Aviation has extended the restriction on domestic and international passenger flights till May 17. The circular reiterates that both foreign and domestic airlines will be ‚Äòsuitably‚Äô informed about restarting operations. The restriction will not apply to international, all-cargo flights, and to those specifically approved by the Director General of Civil Aviation. --- In news from Karnataka, The Karnataka state government has decided to write to the Centre, asking that Bengaluru be split into different zones, so that economic activity can resume in areas that have not registered any Covid-19 cases. As of now, Bengaluru Urban, is seen as one unit, and the district has been declared a red zone. According to the latest data from the State Covid War Room, there are currently 12 wards which are listed as ‚Äúred zones‚Äù within the city. This signifies that a Covid case was reported there in the last 14 days. Another 12 wards are listed as ‚Äúorange zones,‚Äù where a covid case was reported in the last 15 to 28 days. --- State Revenue Minister, R Ashoka, who is also the district in-charge of Bengaluru Rural, has said the district no longer has active cases, and must be marked orange, so that industries can re-open. Most industries are in the Nelamanagala, Doddaballapura and Hoskote region. The government has decided to permit cement factories, steel units, stone crushers, shops selling electrical goods, sanitary products and construction-related items, to prevent the exodus of migrant workers. --- The state government has withdrawn its controversial decision to charge migrant workers, three times the usual bus fare. However, there is still no clarity regarding the revised fares. Many workers had used up the last bit of their savings to buy a ticket, while many who have been without work for more than a month, could not afford to. Earlier in the day, KSRTC had announced that travellers would pay a single fare - and that the Labour department would foot the bill for the buses returning empty. District collectors who had been hiring the buses on contract to bring workers home last week, have stopped doing so. --- If you‚Äôve wondered what the cost of treatment for Covid-19 is, the government is spending between 1.40 to 2.8 lakh rupees for the treatment of a single Covid-19 patient in the state, according to experts. The price range is due to the diverse range of Covid-19 treatments and the duration of treatment. Of the 251 people discharged so far in the State, the majority spent 22 days in hospital quarantine and care. A survey of hospital costs across the designated hospitals has revealed that the standard cost of care for non-ICU Covid patients ranges from 10,000 to 20,000 rupees per day in government hospitals. ICU care results in a 55% increase in this rate. Ambulance costs, testing costs and PPE costs also push the costs higher. --- Moving on, in our fake news segment today, Nitin looks at viral forwards on social media, that have been creating a buzz for all the wrong reasons. This particular post is running wild on WhatsApp and Instagram. It says that 31 people tested positive for Covid-19 in a Delhi locality, and that 26 of them belonged to a single family. The post further says that this is why India needs the controversial population control bill. On April 18, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal live-streamed a 10-minute update on the coronavirus situation. He had specified that a family of 26 had tested positive from the Jahangirpuri ward. This piece of information was quickly published by various media outlets, and related tweets went viral. A handle which goes by the name India Policy, had tweeted that the family of 26, with a husband, his two wives, 12 daughters, 7 sons and more had contracted the virus. The handle has more than one-lakh followers. Tejinder Pal Singh Bagga, a BJP spokesperson retweeted the same promptly. What‚Äôs the truth then? Fact-checking platform AltNews has published the list of 31 people who tested positive for Covid-19 in Jahangirpuri, which dismantles the mischief at play. According to AltNews, Poonam Ashwini Bagri, the municipal councillor of Jahangirpuri has clearly stated that there is no 26-member family in the 31 cases, and that she doesn‚Äôt understand why the Chief Minister chose to highlight this. Stay tuned for more fake news takedowns. Because, unquestioned fake news is as good as the truth. --- Before we go, for most of us in Tier 1 cities, restaurants provide not just a weekend respite but are important aspects of city life. And ever since the lockdown, most hotels and restaurants have been in a crisis. The National Restaurant Association of India, which represents the interests of over 6 lakh restaurants across India, has launched a first-of-its-kind platform to support its members and their employees. The scheme is known as Rise For Restaurants. Diners can support restaurants by buying virtual cash worth Rs 1000 from a list of restaurants across India; the link is also in the description below. This can be redeemed in the future against dining bills at the respective restaurants. At the time of purchase, customers only pay Rs 250. This amount will contribute towards paying the wages and salaries of restaurant employees. The remaining Rs 500 is to be paid by the customer only when they dine at the restaurant.

ROME: Millions of people were allowed to return to work in Italy on Monday as Europe's longest lockdown started to ease, while countries from Iceland to India took a patchwork of steps to loosen coronavirus restrictions.

Businesses including hairdressers in Greece and restaurants in Lebanon were opening their doors under new conditions.

With pressure growing in many countries for more measures to restart the economy, politicians also were trying to boost funding for research into a vaccine for COVID-19.

There are hopes that one could be available in months, but warnings that it could take much longer.

Italy, the first European country to be hit by the pandemic and a nation with one of the world's highest death tolls, started stirring after its two-month shutdown.

In all, 4.4 million Italians were able to return to work, and restrictions on movement eased.

Traffic in downtown Rome picked up, construction sites and manufacturing operations resumed, and flower vendors returned to the Campo dei Fiori market for the first time since March 11.

As infection rates have fallen in large parts of Europe, tentative efforts to restart public life are gathering pace.

But Europeans' new-found freedoms are limited as officials are wary of setting off a second wave of infections.

In Italy, mourners were able to attend funerals - but services were limited to 15 people and there was still no word on when Masses would resume.

Restaurants scrubbed their floors in preparation for take-out service, but sit-down service is several weeks away.

Belgium allowed some companies to open offices to employees, though remote work is still encouraged.

Like Italians, Greeks, Spaniards and many others in Europe, Belgians are being told to wear masks on public transport.

Italians still have to carry certifications explaining why they are out.

The list of acceptable reasons has now been expanded to include visits to family and lovers, but just who falls into that category is still unclear.

Greece, which gradually began lifting its seven-week lockdown Monday, dropped a similar requirement for people to send an SMS or carry a self-written permit justifying being outdoors.

Hair salons and some stores such as those selling books and sports goods reopened, albeit with strict hygiene and distancing measures.

People in hard-hit Spain ventured out for the first time for haircuts or food take-outs, but many small shops were still closed as owners worked on meeting strict health and hygiene guidelines.

Neighbouring Portugal also eased its confinement measures and allowed small stores to open.

On Europe's western edge, Iceland also reopened hair salons - along with high schools, dentists and other businesses - after six weeks in which the country has tamed its virus outbreak.

In the Middle East, Lebanon is allowing restaurants to open at 30% capacity during the day starting Monday.

But many business owners say they won't reopen because they would be losing more money if they operate under such restrictions during a faltering economy, and cafes, clubs and bars have been ordered to stay shut through June.

India allowed some economic activities to resume after a five-week halt, even as the pace of infections has slightly accelerated.

The lockdown has achieved a slowdown in the spread of the virus but has caused immense hardship for poor people.

Russia reported a steady rise in the number of infections, an increase that has fuelled concerns the nation's hospitals could be overwhelmed.

Authorities say that broader testing has contributed to a surge.

Russia's economy has been partially shut down since late March, and lockdown measures have been extended through May 11.

Governments around the world have reported 3.5 million infections and more than 247,000 deaths, including more than 67,000 dead in the United States, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University.

Deliberately concealed outbreaks, low testing rates and the severe strain the disease has placed on health care systems mean the true scale of the pandemic is undoubtedly much greater.

Developing a vaccine will be the key to returning to less restricted everyday life.

On Monday, an alliance of world leaders was holding a virtual summit hoping to drum up around 4 billion euros ($4.37 billion) for vaccine research, some 2 billion euros for treatments and 1.5 billion ($1.64 billion) for testing.

Officials say that amount is just the start.

In a statement, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Norway and top European Union officials said that the money raised will be channeled mostly through recognized global health organizations.

The EU's executive Commission had hoped that the United States would take part, but it remained unclear what role, if any, Washington might play in the donor conference.

Germany's health minister said there are ¬ìpromising¬î developments but warned that developing vaccines is one of the biggest challenges in medecine.

""I would be glad if we succeeded in a few months, but I think we must remain realistic,"" Jens Spahn told ARD television on Sunday.

""It can also take years, because of course there can be setbacks - we have seen that with other vaccines."""

LUCKNOW: With the number of COVID-19 cases advancing past 2600 in Uttar Pradesh, a team of experts from the Centre will be visiting districts in the state with a heavy virus load. To begin with, the team will visit the state capital Lucknow and Agra to assess the COVID-19 situation.

Agra and Lucknow are the two districts topping the tally of COVID-19 cases in the state. Agra has breached the figure of 600 and has the highest number of deaths in the state, with 15.

The district has one in every five COVID-19 patients in Uttar Pradesh. The number of hotspots has gone up to 44 in the district and the local administration has given no relaxation whatsoever in the city of the Taj during lockdown 3.0.

Lucknow has a total of 239 positive cases with 13 hotspots. The city makes up about 8.5 % of the total virus burden of UP. However, the state capital has registered only a single death so far. In Lucknow, the rise in the number of infections is mainly attributed to members of the Tablighi Jamat and their contacts.

As per official sources, 20 teams from the Centre would evaluate the COVID-19 situation in 20 high burden districts across the country.

However, compared to other state capitals like Bhopal, Jaipur and Ahmedabad, Lucknow has been able to keep the number of infections quite low, claimed health authorities.

Moreover, the UP CM also issued directives to senior officers to keep the districts of Agra, Lucknow, Meerut, Saharanpur, Firozabad and Kanpur on continuous surveillance as they have been the worst affected.

Meanwhile, on Monday, the state tally of total active COVID-19 cases rose to 1939 while the overall tally reached 2742. While 64 of the 75 districts of the state have come under the grip of the deadly virus, 758 persons have been discharged after recovery. The state has so far seen the loss of 44 lives.

Moreover, UP has allowed the facility of one nation, one card or national portability of ration cards. ‚ÄúThose coming to UP with the ration card of other states are being given ration in different districts. A person with a ration card of Maharshtra got the ration in Sultanpur. Similarly, those belonging to UP are getting ration in other states,‚Äù said Additional Chief Secretary, home, Awanis Awasthi. He added that two persons from UP got ration in Goa."

As the migrant workers stuck in different states, continue to scramble to return home, Congress interim president Sonia Gandhi declared that the party will bear the cost of travel for every needy migrant worker.

Meanwhile, the number of COVID-19 cases in India surged to 42533 on Monday. So far, 1373 persons have succumbed to the virus, whereas 11707 persons have recovered and have been discharged.

While the country battles this virus, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday made it clear that the time has come to reopen Delhi as people will have to be ready to live with the coronavirus, and said it is impossible that COVID-19 infection cases will be zero. At present, all 11 districts in the city have been declared as red zones.

In Chennai, the spillover of cases from Koyambedu market, the COVID-19 hotspot, is getting bigger."

ROME: Millions of people were allowed to return to work in Italy on Monday as Europe's longest lockdown started to ease, while countries from Iceland to India took a patchwork of steps to loosen coronavirus restrictions.

Businesses including hairdressers in Greece and restaurants in Lebanon were opening their doors under new conditions.

With pressure growing in many countries for more measures to restart the economy, politicians also were trying to boost funding for research into a vaccine for COVID-19.

There are hopes that one could be available in months, but warnings that it could take much longer.

Italy, the first European country to be hit by the pandemic and a nation with one of the world's highest death tolls, started stirring after its two-month shutdown.

In all, 4.4 million Italians were able to return to work, and restrictions on movement eased.

Traffic in downtown Rome picked up, construction sites and manufacturing operations resumed, and flower vendors returned to the Campo dei Fiori market for the first time since March 11.

As infection rates have fallen in large parts of Europe, tentative efforts to restart public life are gathering pace.

But Europeans' new-found freedoms are limited as officials are wary of setting off a second wave of infections.

In Italy, mourners were able to attend funerals - but services were limited to 15 people and there was still no word on when Masses would resume.

Restaurants scrubbed their floors in preparation for take-out service, but sit-down service is several weeks away.

Belgium allowed some companies to open offices to employees, though remote work is still encouraged.

Like Italians, Greeks, Spaniards and many others in Europe, Belgians are being told to wear masks on public transport.

Italians still have to carry certifications explaining why they are out.

The list of acceptable reasons has now been expanded to include visits to family and lovers, but just who falls into that category is still unclear.

Greece, which gradually began lifting its seven-week lockdown Monday, dropped a similar requirement for people to send an SMS or carry a self-written permit justifying being outdoors.

Hair salons and some stores such as those selling books and sports goods reopened, albeit with strict hygiene and distancing measures.

People in hard-hit Spain ventured out for the first time for haircuts or food take-outs, but many small shops were still closed as owners worked on meeting strict health and hygiene guidelines.

Neighbouring Portugal also eased its confinement measures and allowed small stores to open.

On Europe's western edge, Iceland also reopened hair salons - along with high schools, dentists and other businesses - after six weeks in which the country has tamed its virus outbreak.

In the Middle East, Lebanon is allowing restaurants to open at 30% capacity during the day starting Monday.

But many business owners say they won't reopen because they would be losing more money if they operate under such restrictions during a faltering economy, and cafes, clubs and bars have been ordered to stay shut through June.

India allowed some economic activities to resume after a five-week halt, even as the pace of infections has slightly accelerated.

The lockdown has achieved a slowdown in the spread of the virus but has caused immense hardship for poor people.

Russia reported a steady rise in the number of infections, an increase that has fuelled concerns the nation's hospitals could be overwhelmed.

Authorities say that broader testing has contributed to a surge.

Russia's economy has been partially shut down since late March, and lockdown measures have been extended through May 11.

Governments around the world have reported 3.5 million infections and more than 247,000 deaths, including more than 67,000 dead in the United States, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University.

Deliberately concealed outbreaks, low testing rates and the severe strain the disease has placed on health care systems mean the true scale of the pandemic is undoubtedly much greater.

Developing a vaccine will be the key to returning to less restricted everyday life.

On Monday, an alliance of world leaders was holding a virtual summit hoping to drum up around 4 billion euros ($4.37 billion) for vaccine research, some 2 billion euros for treatments and 1.5 billion ($1.64 billion) for testing.

Officials say that amount is just the start.

In a statement, the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Norway and top European Union officials said that the money raised will be channeled mostly through recognized global health organizations.

The EU's executive Commission had hoped that the United States would take part, but it remained unclear what role, if any, Washington might play in the donor conference.

Germany's health minister said there are ¬ìpromising¬î developments but warned that developing vaccines is one of the biggest challenges in medecine.

""I would be glad if we succeeded in a few months, but I think we must remain realistic,"" Jens Spahn told ARD television on Sunday.

""It can also take years, because of course there can be setbacks - we have seen that with other vaccines."""
