Today, in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, face masks have had not only their spelling updated but, far more importantly, their function upgraded to that of crucially important protective equipment, with many places in India and across the world making it mandatory for them to be worn in public areas. However, even in these grim times, fashion can and indeed does, play a part in their making and in encouraging their use.

A number of Italian producers of haute couture, their names all ending in ‘i’, have begun to turn out these facial shields against infection. Indeed, fashionistas can not only make masks but also popularise their widespread use. Sartorial history shows that what today are called ‘influencers’ can make dress codes go viral. The 18 th century dandy, Beau Brummell, got Englishmen, starting with the then Prince Regent, to switch almost overnight from knee breeches to trousers. With face masks bearing designer tags – sans the astronomical price tabs associated with such labels – the fashion-conscious would be motivated to wear them, thereby showing themselves to be smart – not only in the way they think but also in the way they look."
https://www.indiatimes.com/trending/environment/aerosol-particle-levels-in-northern-india-plummet-owing-to-coronavirus-lockdown-511475.html,"We know that air pollution levels over countries that have been put under lockdown around the world, owing to coronavirus outbreak, have plummeted. Now, NASA's satellites have observed aerosol levels in northern India to be at a 20-year low, for this time of year, after the country was put under lockdown on March 25.

A report observes that every year, ‘aerosols from anthropogenic (human-made) sources contribute to unhealthy levels of air pollution in many Indian cities’. Aerosols can be described as ‘tiny solid and liquid particles suspended in the air that reduce visibility and can damage the human lungs and heart'.

The report goes on to mention the different types of aerosols - 'Some aerosols have natural sources, such as dust storms, volcanic eruptions, and forest fires. Others come from human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels and croplands. Human-made aerosols tend to contribute most of the smaller particles that have greater potential for damaging human health’.

“We knew we would see changes in atmospheric composition in many places during the lockdown. But I have never seen aerosol values so low in the Indo-Gangetic Plain at this time of year,” the report quotes Pawan Gupta, a Universities Space Research Association (USRA) scientist at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center as saying.”

The maps compare the aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements over India during the same period - March 31 to April 5 - for each year, from 2016 through 2020.

The map named anomaly shows how AOD in 2020 compared to the average for 2016-2019. Aerosol optical depth is a ‘measure of how light is absorbed or reflected by airborne particles as it travels through the atmosphere’.

This data was accumulated by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite.

Typically, in early spring, in the Ganges Valley of northern India, human activities generate the majority of aerosols. Activities of industries, coal-fired power plants, vehicles produce nitrates and sulfates and other carbon-rich particles.

The report concludes that the 2020 lockdown reduced those human-made emission sources in urban and rural India.

NASA

These aerosol levels might increase slightly in the upcoming weeks in parts of India as seasonal dust storms begin.

“The hard part with understanding aerosols is that particles can move based on wind patterns and other meteorology. You have to disentangle what is caused by the human fingerprint versus a meteorological factor,” the report quotes Robert Levy, program leader for NASA’s MODIS aerosol products, as saying.

In the first few days of the lockdown, scientists believed that there was low aerosol level owing to a combination of rain and the lockdown. But they found that the levels didn’t go up after the rain. The same pattern was not observed in Southern India, but scientists believe that could be owing to wind patterns or the weather.

For the time being, low levels of these particles in the air, mean fresher air for northern India to breathe.

The findings, published in the journal PLOS ONE, will help understand the diversity of coronaviruses in bats and inform global efforts to detect, prevent and respond to infectious diseases that may threaten public health, particularly in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

According to the researchers from the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute in the US, studies will evaluate the potential for transmission across species to better understand the risks to human health.

Representational Image

They said the newly discovered coronaviruses are not closely related to coronaviruses Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS CoV-1), Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) or SARS-CoV-2.

""Viral pandemics remind us how closely human health is connected to the health of wildlife and the environment,"" said Marc Valitutto, former wildlife veterinarian with the Smithsonian's Global Health Program, and lead author of the study.

""Worldwide, humans are interacting with wildlife with increasing frequency, so the more we understand about these viruses in animals --what allows them to mutate and how they spread to other species -- the better we can reduce their pandemic potential,"" Valitutto said.

Agencies

Researchers detected these new viruses while conducting surveillance of animals and people to better understand the circumstances for disease spillover.

The team focused their research on sites in Myanmar where humans are more likely to come into close contact with local wildlife due to changes in land use and development.

From May 2016 to August 2018, they collected more than 750 saliva and faecal samples from bats in these areas.

Experts estimate that thousands of coronaviruses -- many of which have yet to be discovered -- are present in bats.

Researchers tested and compared the samples to known coronaviruses and identified six new coronaviruses for the first time.

Agencies

The team also detected a coronavirus that had been found elsewhere in Southeast Asia, but never before in Myanmar.

Coronaviruses have caused widespread disease in humans, including SARS CoV-1, MERS and most recently the global COVID-19 pandemic.

The researchers said these findings underscore the importance of surveillance for zoonotic diseases as they occur in wildlife.

The results will guide future surveillance of bat populations to better detect potential viral threats to public health, they said.

""Many coronaviruses may not pose a risk to people, but when we identify these diseases early on in animals, at the source, we have a valuable opportunity to investigate the potential threat,"" said Suzan Murray, director of the Smithsonian's Global Health Program and co-author of the study.

Covid-19 Impact Is So Disastrous That It Could Push 42-66 Million Children To Extreme Poverty

The coronavirus pandemic is set to affect the global economy, jobs, markets and almost everything. Even though the children are not a face of this pandemic, they are prone to massive risks.

According to a report by the United Nations, the coronavirus pandemic could push an estimated 42-66 million children into extreme poverty and the economic downturn resulting from the outbreak could result in hundreds of thousands of additional child deaths in 2020.

""Children are not the face of this pandemic. But they risk being among its biggest victims. While they have thankfully been largely spared from the direct health effects of COVID-19 - at least to date - the crisis is having a profound effect on their wellbeing,"" according to a new 'Policy Brief: The impact of COVID-19 on children'' released by the United Nations on Thursday.

The brief said that there are three main channels through which children are affected by this crisis - infection with the virus itself; the immediate socioeconomic impacts of measures to stop transmission of the virus and end the pandemic; and the potential longer-term effects of delayed implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.

Nearly 42-66 million children could fall into extreme poverty as a result of the crisis this year, adding to the estimated 386 million children already in extreme poverty in 2019.

The pandemic has also exacerbated the learning crisis as 188 countries have imposed countrywide school closures, affecting more than 1.5 billion children and youth.

According to estimates by Johns Hopkins University, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases surpassed two million globally and 139,419 people have died so far. The US is the worst hit with more than 640,000 Covid-19 cases and 31,000 deaths.

On the threats to child survival and health, the policy brief said, ""economic hardship experienced by families as a result of the global economic downturn could result in an hundreds of thousands of additional child deaths in 2020, reversing the last 2 to 3 years of progress in reducing infant mortality within a single year.""

While almost all the industries have taken a hit the travel and tourism industry have taken a pounding. Initially starting with international and later domestically tour operators, resorts and hotels saw cancellations and postponements on a scale that has never seen before.

AFP

This also reflected in the aviation industry, which was already struggling due to the reducing passengers and growing restrictions on flying to their international routes. Initially many of the airlines had tried scaling down their operations but after the lockdown was announced, the airlines too had no option but to suspend service.



AFP

This has taken a toll on the airline companies who have been forced to refund customers who had already booked tickets. This is not the only loss they have incurred. For every passing day, the airlines have to pay parking and housing charges that an airline has to pay the airport to park its planes.

There are about 650 aircraft belonging to the likes of IndiGo, Air India, SpiceJet and GoAir that have been grounded at various airports.



The fees depend on the weight of the flight and the amount could run into lakhs of Rupees every day. Airlines have approached the government to waive off these parking charges, on which a decision is yet to be taken.

As of now both domestic and international flights are suspended till May 3 and there is no clarity on what happens after that. Still, many are planning to resume operations from May 4.

Meanwhile most airlines have again decided not to refund customers in cash for their cancelled flights and instead have offered them rescheduling of tickets for a later date without any additional fee.

""Following orders from the Ministry of Civil Aviation issued to all airlines, we have extended the suspension of our operations until May 3, 2020. ""We are in the process of cancelling the affected bookings and we will offer customers free of charge rescheduling to another date until December 31, 2020,"" a Vistara spokesperson said in a statement.

The customer, however, will have to pay the fare difference, if any, at the time of rebooking, the airline said.



A GoAir spokesperson said that it has already ""factored in"" these type of scenario and that the airline will review its earlier scheme of providing rescheduling free of cost at a later date while protecting their existing bookings for one year.

""In accordance with the Prime Minister’s instructions and the DGCA’s circular, GoAir has suspended all its flights till May 3,"" GoAir said in a statement on Tuesday. The airline also said it is extending its ''Protect Your PNR'' scheme till May 3, 2020 wherein customers are eligible to reschedule their flight by May 3, 2021. The airline had on Monday announced that it was extending the “Protect Your PNR” scheme till April 30, 2020.

SpiceJet also said that it is in the process of making cancellation on flight bookings. ""Upon cancellation your entire amount will be maintained in a credit shell and the same may be used to make fresh booking and travel till 28 February 2021 for the same passenger,"" it added.



India’s largest airline IndiGo said on Tuesday that it will resume flight operations May 4 onwards, initially with a curtailed capacity. The airline said it will increase the operating capacity going ahead over the subsequent months, also re-opening some international flights.

Coronavirus Has Affected China So Bad That Its Economy Has Seen A 6.8% Fall, Worst Since 1992

For the first time in decades, China's economy shrank in the first quarter as coronavirus shut down hit the country hard and put millions out of work.

The world's second biggest economy saw its GDP fall by 6.8% in January-March year-on-year, according to official data released on Friday. It marks the first time since 1992 that the country's GDP fell in the first quarter.

The historic slump in economy comes after efforts to contain the coronavirus, which first emerged in China late last year, shut down factories, transport and shopping malls.



The financial toll the coronavirus is having on the Chinese economy will be a huge concern to other countries. China is an economic powerhouse as a major consumer and producer of goods and services.

Reuters

On a quarter-on-quarter basis, GDP fell 9.8% in the first three months of the year, the National Bureau of Statistics said, which compared with expectations for a 9.9% contraction and 1.5% growth in the previous quarter.

However, it is not likely to be market-ready any time this year, as a vaccine has to go through several clinical examinations to ascertain its efficiency, side effects, and long-term impact, etc.



But rest assured, once the vaccine hits the market, the rich countries of the world are going to grab all they can and even will be ready to pay extra for it, leaving the poor countries in the lurch.

Not just any vaccine, but a vaccine that many experts believe will be the first in the world to be commercialised.

The UK government has announced that human trial of a potential Coronavirus vaccine being developed by Oxford University researchers will begin from Thursday. Last week, even the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has supported the Oxford vaccine, called 'ChAdOX1', calling it the frontrunner in the race for a COVID-19 vaccine.

According to the UK government, the potential Oxford University coronavirus vaccine will be on up to 510 people aged between 18 and 55, out of an overall group of 1,112 volunteers who've been selected and finalised for the COVID-19 vaccine trial.



The information of fast-tracking the Oxford vaccine trial was revealed by UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock while briefing the UK parliament on how they're pretty much 'throwing everything at' Britain's attempt to develop the first coronavirus vaccine in the world, according to a DailyMail report.

That's not all, the UK government is also funding scientists with an extra 20 million pounds to help with their trials, and offering a further 22.5 million pounds to another Coronavirus vaccine project underway at the Imperial College London, according to an IANS report.

What's the Oxford coronavirus vaccine?

According to lead researcher Professor Sarah Gilbert, their 'ChAdOx1' vaccine can work against the coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. Sure, a lot of potential COVID-19 vaccines claim to do that. So what's special about the Oxford University vaccine after all?



Reuters

What probably separates ChAdOx1 -- known as recombinant viral vector vaccine -- from the rest is the time it promises to take in order to deliver mass quantities.



The Oxford coronavirus vaccine is supposed to be an adenovirus vaccine vector developed at Oxford's Jenner Institute. Adenoviral vectors are a very well-studied vaccine type, having been used safely in thousands of participants, from 1 week to 90 years of age, in vaccines targeting over 10 different diseases, reports suggest.



If all goes well with the human trial stage of this Oxford University coronavirus vaccine, the research team is extremely hopeful of aggressively meeting their own internal deadline of having this certified and mass produced for everyone to use by September of this year. Let's hope for their success in meeting that milestone, for the sake of all humanity and innocent lives!"

According to an IANS report, the donor had recovered from COVID-19 three weeks ago and tested coronavirus negative at the time of donation, along with other tests to rule out conditions like Hepatitis C, Hepatitis B and HIV.



Fresh plasma was administered to the critically-ill patient as a treatment modality on the night of April 14. After undergoing the plasma treatment, the patient showed improvement and by the fourth day, he was put off ventilator support, on the morning of April 18 and continued on supplementary oxygen afterwards.

The treatment, known as convalescent plasma (CP) therapy, was used during the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic before vaccines or antivirals were available.

Plasma Therapy Shows Best Result In COVID-19 Treatment In India: All You Need To Know

COVID-19 cases in India are skyrocketing. Today, India has over 18,601 people who are infected with the novel coronavirus, while 590 people have died as of now due to COVID-19.

Reuters

Medical authorities have been working tirelessly to find a viable treatment method that can effectively cure COVID-19, eliminating its existence from our nation.

Last week, ICMR authorised the conduction of a clinical trial for plasma therapy against COVID-19 and since then, several medical institutions across the nation have started to implement it for their patients and most of the results have been promising.

What is Plasma Therapy?

Plasma Therapy or convalescent plasma is essentially a procedure where the immunity power gained by a patient after recovering from COVID-19 is harnessed and applied to other infected patients, offering them the immunity to ward off the coronavirus.

Dr Asha Kishore, Director, SCTIMST, (in a conversation with India Science Wire) explains, “When a pathogen like novel coronavirus infect, our immune systems produce antibodies. Like the police dogs, the antibodies span out to identify and mark the invading virus.”

Reuters

She added, “White blood cells attach the identified intruders, and the body gets rid of the infection. The therapy, like blood transfusion, harvests the antibody from a recovered patient and ingest into a sick person. Helped by the antibody, the immune system mounts robust combat on the virus.”

Basically, blood plasma from recovered patients has the immunity to fight against COVID-19. This immunity when transferred in infected patients, gives them a stronger weapon to fight against the novel coronavirus.

Plasma Therapy Positive Results

Within a week from the treatment going active, it has shown promising results in the patients. According to a recent TOI report, one of the first COVID-19 patient to receive plasma therapy in a Delhi hospital Max Healthcare has already recovered and off from the ventilator.

A patient in Central Florida by the name of Kevin Rathel was put on plasma therapy after his condition deteriorated due to COVID-19, with him being on life support. However, after 18 days of fighting battle with COVID-19, plasma therapy worked and now he’s fully recovered and with his family at home.

Plasma Therapy: A Silver Bullet?

Surely, looking at the success stories, one might surely wonder if this is finally the silver bullet, the cure to taking down COVID-19 and bringing things back to normal.

Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, Group Medical Director at Max Healthcare and Senior Director at the Institute of Internal medicine states, “We are delighted that the therapy worked well in his case, opening a new treatment opportunity during these challenging times. But it is important that we also understand that Plasma Therapy is no magic bullet.”

He further added, “During the patient’s treatment at Max Hospital, Saket, other standard treatment protocols were followed and we can say that Plasma Therapy could have worked as a Catalyst in speeding up his recovery. We cannot attribute 100 percent recovery to Plasma Therapy only, as there are multiple factors which carved his path to recovery.""

However, today the conditions aren’t as bad as they’re in the US or Italy. Regardless, to be prepared for the worst, innovators are gearing up with novel solutions to take down the coronavirus, and one Aryan Paper Group from Vapi, Gujarat, have developed a portable and light bed made entirely out of cardboard.



The bed was designed to be easy to carry around and install on makeshift hospitals in rural and urban areas, should such situations arise.

Now in case you were wondering about the structural integrity of the beds, considering they’re made of cardboard, you’d be surprised to know that these can easily withstand weight up to 200 kilograms while weighing just under 10 kilograms.



Aryan Paper

Moreover, the bed is designed keeping medical use in mind, thus it is coated with a special chemical that makes it water repellant, basically, even if some liquid spills on it, it won’t affect the bed’s structural integrity.

One of the best things about the design is that it’s completely tool-less, meaning you don’t need nails, hammer, to build it. Just connect cardboard using slots (just like in arts and crafts projects in school) and the entire bed is ready to admit a patient in minutes. And since the bed is made of cardboard, it is biodegradable, which means it won’t cause unnecessary waste in dumping grounds.

Aryan Paper

Sure, the bed cannot be used for extremely critical patients, since they are normally taken from one facility to another for tests, but this can surely come in helpful for not very serious cases.



Each bed can roughly cost you between Rs 900 to Rs 1000, along with the additional cost for transport depending on the location. They’re currently supplying to Gujarat government, Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai as well as the Indian Navy."

200 US Companies Wanted To Ditch China For India In 2019, That Number May Grow In 2020

Multinational firms across the globe had since long been pondering upon the prospect of shifting their manufacturing bases from China to other countries.

The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus now comes as a stark reminder of the necessity of the move. If so, India might stand to gain from this by being the next manufacturing destination.

India manufacturing hub

To be clear, the vision of India being one of the prime manufacturing hubs is not new. Back in April last year, around 200 US-based companies were seeking to move their manufacturing base from China to India. The interest was highlighted by a top US-based advocacy group, anticipating continues efforts towards the same post the general elections in India.



The enthusiasm did not really yield a significant investment in manufacturing hubs in the country at the time. The interest, however, has rekindled in recent times due to the massive impact on supply chains. The Coronavirus induced lockdown in China was enough to set several industries come to a standstill and this dependency on the nation is now under scrutiny.

What's India’s response

India is familiar with the situation and is actively making efforts towards it. Back in March, the Indian government came up with three schemes for a total of Rs 48,000 crore worth of incentives to boost mobile phone manufacturing within the country. The incentives were aimed to attract top smartphone players including Apple, Samsung, Oppo and Vivo to set up their entire value chain in India. The idea was to then make India as their export hub.

An ET report quotes a situational analysis by a top government official looking into the matter, ”the government is working to address disabilities across sectors, including for pharmaceuticals and automobiles, to try and establish India as an alternate to China for manufacturing for local and global markets across sectors,”



Building on the efforts, the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) has now set up Renewable Industry Facilitation & Promotion Board to facilitate investment in the sector. The ministry has also got in touch with trade representatives of various countries inviting them to ""invest in this promising opportunity in India"", a recent release by the ministry mentions.

In addition, the centre had slashed corporate tax to 25.17 percent back in September last year. Applicable tax for new manufacturers was also cut to lowest in South East Asia at 17 percent. The centre is now focussing on reducing the production cost in various sectors.

India as a preferred manufacturing destination

While India prepares for the opportunity at hand, companies are actively seeking the transition as well. A report by Business Today mentions around 1000 companies to have shared their proposals with the Indian government, for setting up their alternate manufacturing hubs in the country.

""About 1,000-odd companies are currently engaged in discussion at various levels such as investment promotion cell, central government departments and state governments. Out of these companies, we are targeting 300-odd companies,"" the report quotes a top official. The interest pans across the industries of electronics, medical devices, textiles and synthetic fabric.

(Representative Image: Reuters)

The interest is mutual among major trading nations including the US, Japan, South Korea and others, majorly propelled by the recent and prolonged break in supply chain from the far east nation.



Last week, the Japanese government earmarked a record economic stimulus package worth $2.2 billion to help its manufacturers shift production out of China.

Several firms from other parts of the globe are following suit. Apple’s manufacturing partner Wistron Corp, for instance, was considering to assemble printed circuit boards (PCBs) for iPhones at its new plant in southern India. The new assembly line, if and when it comes, will be in addition to the a few models of iPhone assembled within the country already.

Indian metaphoric history that west calls mythology is full of narrations of extremely strange phenomena. We have a whole list of various asuras with superpowers that will have even Marvel Comics creative team wondering, and each of this asura is ultimately killed by either Shiva or, even more interestingly by one of the Matrikas.

Each of these tales read like J.G.Ballard sci-fi but with a social message, and of all those tales, the one that hits us hard today is of Rakta-bija.

Rakta-bij is an asur.

(I would not translate asur as demon, as no Indian character can be or should be equated with any western words. Even asurs trace their linage with devas. And if we look deep enough, even the original idea of demon is also not “evil” as the post-renaissance shallow reinterpretation of the many such ancient ideas has turned it into).

Like most asura that feature in such stories, Rakta-bija is also bestowed upon with a superpower via a boon and that provides him with a very interesting quality.

As the name suggests, whenever any drop of his blood (rakta) dropped on the ground, it turned into a seed (bij) from which a new Rakta-bij was born.

It has hard not to relate this with a new age asura that we are fighting today in from of coronavirus as it is showing exactly the same ability that is preventing us from annihilating it with even with the best of modern technologies.

This obviously will make us curious about how Rakta-bij was ultimately defeated. And what is really interesting in the story of Rakta-bij that makes it even more relevant today is that, it is not the Rakta-bija but the solution used to destroy him later turned into a bigger problem that had to be solved by Shiva himself!

As depicted in the eighth chapter of the Devi Mahatmya dealing with raktabij-vadh, it was Mata Ambika who engaged in a battle with Rakta-bija.

It should be interesting to note that, every time devas found themselves in trouble against asura, they always resorted to one of the Matrikas to win the war!

When Ambika and other Matrika fought Rakta-bija, they soon realised that he was impossible to defeat thanks to the boon that led to birth of even more Rakta-bijas every time he bled.

This is the point where Mata Kali intervened and used her tongue to lick every drop of blood before it could beget another Rakta-bij.

The metaphoric story doesn’t stop here, as this led Mata Kali to get into a rampage and she started killing every living being in sight.

Ultimately, Shiva had to turn into a dead log and lay in her way. When Kali stepped on this dead log and realised it was Shiva, she stopped in embarrassment with her tongue hanging out.

In the story of coronavirus, I sense Mata Kali to be our economy. We are deploying it to lick the virus, and we may defeat the virus using it too, but she is likely to go into a rampage that will need to be stopped.

At some point, we will need a new-age shiva who can stop her the way Shiva did. I will leave the rest of the metaphor open to interpretation in hope, as we need our shiva to act soon."

But there is no denying the fact that Kerala is doing certain things right. Its track record of investing in public healthcare over decades is clearly holding it in good stead now. But what really seems to have mattered is Kerala’s functioning grassroots bodies. The latter enabled community outreach, rigorous contact tracing and mass quarantine with public participation. Add to this high levels of literacy in the state, and it seems that Kerala was better prepared to handle the outbreak despite having some of the same issues on testing faced by other states.

The lesson from Kerala is that investment in public health pays for itself many times over. And when that is complemented by grassroots participation it forms a strong health shield against epidemics and other threats. Kerala won the battle against the Nipah virus outbreak in 2018. And now it is doing significantly better than other states in tackling the coronavirus. Therefore, once the current crisis blows over, the Kerala model of healthcare should definitely be studied for replication elsewhere."

મૃતકના દીકરાએ વહીવટી તંત્રને ચિઠ્ઠી લખીને જણાવ્યું કે, તે મૃતદેહ નહીં સ્વીકારી શકે. એવામાં મામલતદારે દીકરાની ફરજ નિભાવી. આ ઘટના શુજલાપુરની છે, ત્યાં રહેતા પ્રેમ સિંહ મેવાડાનું મોત 20 એપ્રિલે કોરોનાના કારણે થયું હતું. તેમની સારવાર ભોપાલની એક ખાનગી હોસ્પિટલમાં ચાલતી હતી. જિલ્લા પ્રશાસનની ટીમ સતત પરિવારના સંપર્કમાં હતી.

દીકરો અંતિમ સંસ્કાર કરવા આવશે તે આશાએ પિતાનું શબ મડદાઘરમાં રાખવામાં આવ્યું હતું. જિલ્લા અધિકારીઓએ ઘણી વિનંતી છતાં પણ દીકરો આવવા તૈયાર ના થયો. તેને ડર હતો કે જો તે મૃતદેહ લેવા જશે તો તે પણ કોરોનાથી સંક્રમિત થશે. દીકરાની ચિઠ્ઠી મળ્યા બાદ પ્રશાસને પોતે જ પ્રેમ સિંહ મેવાડાના અંતિમ સંસ્કાર કરાવવાનો નિર્ણય કર્યો હતો.

પ્રેમ સિંહ મેવાડાના પુત્ર સંદીપ મેવાડાએ લખ્યું, ‘મારા પિતાજી કોરોનાથી સંક્રમિત હતા અને તેમનું નિધન 20 એપ્રિલે થયું છે. હું સ્વયં મારી મરજીથી પિતાનું શબ પ્રશાસનને સોંપું છું. તેઓ જ પિતાના અંતિમ સંસ્કાર કરશે. આ બધું જ હું સ્વેચ્છાએ કરી રહ્યો છું. કારણકે મને કિટ પહેરતા આવડતી નથી અને તેના નિયમો અંગે પણ જાણ નથી. તેને કેવી રીતે પહેરવાની છે અને કાઢવાની છે તે ખબર નથી. આ બધું જ હું લેખિતમાં મામલતદારને આપું છું.’

दावा

समुद्र किनारे कई शवों वाले एक विडियो को वॉट्सऐप पर इस दावे के साथ शेयर किया जा रहा है कि जिन लोगों की मौत कोरोनावायरस से हुई है उनके शवों को अब समुद्र में फेंका जा रहा है। इस विडियो के साथ जो टेक्स्ट शेयर किया जा रहा है उसमें लोगों से समुद्री मछली न खाने को कहा गया है।

विडियो के साथ जो संदेश भेजा गया है वह इस तरह है, ‘कोई भी समुद्र की मछली न खाएं क्योंकि कोरोना से मरे हुए मुर्दों को समुद्र में फेंकना चालू हो गया है..तो उन मुर्दों को मछली खाएगी…और वो मछली को आप खावोगे तो क्या होगा आप ही सोचो।’

टाइम्स फैक्ट चेक के एक पाठक ने विडियो की सच्चाई जाननी चाही।

सच क्या है?

विडियो साल 2014 का है। विडियो लीबियाई तट का है जहां लगभग 100 शरणार्थियों के शव बरामद किए गए थे। इसका कोरोनावायरस से कोई लेना-देना नहीं है।

कैसे की पड़ताल?

यूट्यूब पर कुछ की वर्ड्स सर्च करने से हमें Euronews नामके चैनल पर 26 अगस्त, 2014 को अपलोड किया गया विडियो मिला। इसका शीर्षक, ‘Dozens of migrant bodies are washed ashore in Libya’ था। विडियो के विजुअल्स भी अब वायरल हो रहे विडियो से मेल खाते हैं।

विडियो के साथ दी गई जानकारी के मुताबिक, लीबियाई प्रशासन ने समुद्र किनारे से 100 से ज्यादा शव बरामद किए। ये संभवत: बीते हफ्ते जहाज पलटने के शिकार हुए लोगों के शव हैं।

निष्कर्ष

टाइम्स फैक्ट चेक ने पाया है कि लीबिया का पुराना विडियो इस गलत दावे के साथ शेयर किया जा रहा है कि कोरोनावायरस से मरने वाले लोगों के शव समुद्र में फेंके जा रहे हैं।"

कभी सोचा भी नहीं था कि लाइफ बिना रफ्तार के भी पूरी मस्ती में दौड़ेगी।



जब पूरा हिंदुस्तान एक साथ एक रूप एक ही अंदाज में जुड़ा होगा, इंतहाईं सामाजिक दूरी के बावजूद सबकी ख्वाहिशें बेतरह एक-सी हो चुकी होंगी, ख्वाब और हकीकत भी इतने एक से हो गए होंगे कि सन्नाटे में गूँजती निःशब्दता भी स्पष्ट मालूम पड़ने लगी है......निःसारता में ही समग्र सारवान होने का बेहद सुखद अनुभव ! अहा, अद्भुत है ईश्वरीय विधान !











जीवन उहापोह और विचित्रताओं का संयोजन है।अनादिकाल से मनुष्य व्यथा, पीड़ा, आश्चर्य, जिज्ञासाओं, उत्साह और रहस्यों का पुंज रहा है। प्रकृति के ऊपर विजय पाने की मनुष्य की लालसा उसे प्रकृति से दूर करती रही। वस्तुतः प्राकृतिक घटनाएं हमें हमेशा से चौंकाती रही हैं। इसलिए उनके प्रति सहज आकर्षण भी जन्म लेता ही है। इसी क्रम में सामाजिक व्यवस्था का उद्भव और विकास भी होता गया क्योंकि मानव की सुरक्षा के लिए ये एक स्वाभाविक परिणति भी रही है। किंतु विकास का हर कदम आंतरिक की बजाय वाह्य प्रगति या कहें अंतर्यात्रा की जगह बहिर्यात्रा की ओर उन्मुख होता है फलस्वरूप मानसिक उलझनों का संजाल बढ़ने लगता है।













वर्तमान विषाणु जन्य समस्या या कहें भयावहता कहीं ना कहीं मनुष्य की सभ्यता को एक नई दिशा देने वाली सिद्ध होने जा रही है। जब एकांत और अकेलापन जैसी दुःसाध्य मुश्किलें इंसानी जीवन को रास्ता दिखाने लगी हों, जब उत्साह और भागदौड़ भरी लाइफ़ की जटिलताएं नवजीवन का रास्ता तैयार कर रही हों, जब बहिर्यात्रा के ऊपर पुनः अंतर्यात्रा की पृष्ठभूमि निर्मित हो रही हो तो ऐसे में संस्कृति के नए आयाम दृष्टिगत होने ही लगेंगे............
