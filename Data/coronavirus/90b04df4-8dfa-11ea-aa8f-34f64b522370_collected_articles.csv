The incident happened at the Wockhardt hospital in Mumbai on May 1, a day after the patient was admitted there.

What is even more shocking is that the accused doctor had joined the hospital on the same day the COVID-19 patient was admitted there and committed the crime on his first day at work.

According to an Indian Express report, the 34-year old was recruited by the hospital after it allowed doctors above the age of 60 and those with comorbidities to remain at home due to the COVID-19 situation. The doctor allegedly entered the patient's room and made sexual advances after which the latter raised an alarm.

Based on a complaint by the hospital the Mumbai police have booked the doctor under IPC sections 377 (unnatural offences), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of diseases endangering life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of diseases endangering life).

However, he has not been arrested by the cops as they fear that he too might have contracted the virus from the patient. The doctor is currently under home isolation.

Meanwhile, the hospital has said that the services of the doctor have been terminated.

The sexual assault on the patient is more bad news for the Wockhardt hospital which just reopened on April 23. The hospital was forced to shut by the BMC after some 80 staffers including doctors and nurses were infected with COVID-19.

The staffers were infected from a 70-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital with a heart attack, who later tested positive for COVID-19 and died. He was reportedly admitted in the general ICU, along with other patients and two nurses who were attending him without any protection were the first to contract the virus.

Only after more nurses started showing symptoms and becoming sick the hospital began testing more of its staff.

Wockhardt which was one of the dedicated COVID-19 hospitals in Mumbai was shut and was declared a containment zone. It was only allowed to resume recently, after being sealed for nearly a month with just 30 beds to treat patients."

The sexual assault on the patient is more bad news for the Wockhardt hospital which just reopened on April 23. The hospital was forced to shut by the BMC after some 80 staffers including doctors and nurses were infected with COVID-19.

The staffers were infected from a 70-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital with a heart attack, who later tested positive for COVID-19 and died. He was reportedly admitted in the general ICU, along with other patients and two nurses who were attending him without any protection were the first to contract the virus.

The incident happened at the Wockhardt hospital in Mumbai on May 1, a day after the patient was admitted there.

What is even more shocking is that the accused doctor had joined the hospital on the same day the COVID-19 patient was admitted there and committed the crime on his first day at work.

According to an Indian Express report, the 34-year old was recruited by the hospital after it allowed doctors above the age of 60 and those with comorbidities to remain at home due to the COVID-19 situation. The doctor allegedly entered the patient's room and made sexual advances after which the latter raised an alarm.

Based on a complaint by the hospital the Mumbai police have booked the doctor under IPC sections 377 (unnatural offences), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of diseases endangering life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of diseases endangering life).

However, he has not been arrested by the cops as they fear that he too might have contracted the virus from the patient. The doctor is currently under home isolation.

What is even more shocking is that the accused doctor had joined the hospital on the same day the COVID-19 patient was admitted there and committed the crime on his first day at work.

According to an Indian Express report, the 34-year old was recruited by the hospital after it allowed doctors above the age of 60 and those with comorbidities to remain at home due to the COVID-19 situation. The doctor allegedly entered the patient's room and made sexual advances after which the latter raised an alarm.

Based on a complaint by the hospital the Mumbai police have booked the doctor under IPC sections 377 (unnatural offences), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of diseases endangering life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of diseases endangering life).

However, he has not been arrested by the cops as they fear that he too might have contracted the virus from the patient. The doctor is currently under home isolation.

Meanwhile, the hospital has said that the services of the doctor have been terminated.

The sexual assault on the patient is more bad news for the Wockhardt hospital which just reopened on April 23. The hospital was forced to shut by the BMC after some 80 staffers including doctors and nurses were infected with COVID-19.

The staffers were infected from a 70-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital with a heart attack, who later tested positive for COVID-19 and died. He was reportedly admitted in the general ICU, along with other patients and two nurses who were attending him without any protection were the first to contract the virus.

Only after more nurses started showing symptoms and becoming sick the hospital began testing more of its staff.

Wockhardt which was one of the dedicated COVID-19 hospitals in Mumbai was shut and was declared a containment zone. It was only allowed to resume recently, after being sealed for nearly a month with just 30 beds to treat patients."

The staffers were infected from a 70-year-old man who was admitted to the hospital with a heart attack, who later tested positive for COVID-19 and died. He was reportedly admitted in the general ICU, along with other patients and two nurses who were attending him without any protection were the first to contract the virus.

The incident happened at the Wockhardt hospital in Mumbai on May 1, a day after the patient was admitted there.

What is even more shocking is that the accused doctor had joined the hospital on the same day the COVID-19 patient was admitted there and committed the crime on his first day at work.

According to an Indian Express report, the 34-year old was recruited by the hospital after it allowed doctors above the age of 60 and those with comorbidities to remain at home due to the COVID-19 situation. The doctor allegedly entered the patient's room and made sexual advances after which the latter raised an alarm.

Based on a complaint by the hospital the Mumbai police have booked the doctor under IPC sections 377 (unnatural offences), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of diseases endangering life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of diseases endangering life).

However, he has not been arrested by the cops as they fear that he too might have contracted the virus from the patient. The doctor is currently under home isolation.

https://www.deccanherald.com/national/spike-in-covid-19-cases-continue-in-up-returning-migrant-workers-give-officials-scare-833394.html,"As the spike in the COVID-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh continued to spike, the flood of returning migrant workers was certain to be a huge scare for the authorities in the state.

UP recorded an increase of over 700 COVID-19 cases in the past one week even as the state government ramped up testing, which stood at over one lakh as on Monday. Over 1.47 lakh people have been put under home isolation.

The Taj city of Agra, where the first COVID-19 case in the state had been reported, continued to witness a sharp increase in the coronavirus positive cases. The district alone accounted for a little less than one-fourth of the total over 2700 cases in the state.

The mayor of Agra, Naveen Jain, a senior BJP leader, even said that the district could well be on the way of becoming 'Wuhan' of the country. Ironically the centre had, in the early days of Virus spread, praised what the state government had touted as the 'Agra Model' in containing the infections.

The situation in the state capital of Lucknow was no better as it was in the 'red zone'. Several areas in the city had been designated as hot spots.

Amid the rising cases of COVID-19, the expected arrival of lakhs of stranded migrant workers from different parts in the country was certain to give sleepless nights to the authorities, especially when around a dozen migrant workers, who had returned to the state before the 'Shramik Special' trains started, tested positive for Coronavirus in some districts.

All those, who tested positive, had arrived in the state from Maharashtra and Gujarat. The authorities suspect that there may be coronavirus positive cases among the migrant workers, who are returning from the special trains.

Around two lakh migrant workers and their families, who included both residents of the state and Bihar, had arrived in different parts in the state after the first lockdown was declared. The arrivals continued in the second lockdown as well.

The state government was also facing problems in accommodating such a huge number of people in the quarantine centres. Complaints of humiliation and mistreatment of the people and acute shortage of food and other eatables had poured in from different places.

Under this initiative, SHGs will be able to list their products on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) in five categories -- handicrafts; handloom and textiles; office accessories; grocery and pantry, and personal care and hygiene.

In the first phase, 913 SHGs from 11 states have already registered as sellers and 403 products have been onboarded, GeM said in a statement.

""A unique initiative of GeM and the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana-NRLM, the Saras Collection would showcase daily utility products made by rural self-help groups and aims to provide SHGs in rural areas with market access to government buyers,"" it said.

To develop a scalable model capable of onboarding a large number of SHGs across the country in a short time frame, GeM has developed an API (application programming interface) based integration mechanism with the NRLM (National Rural Livelihoods Mission) database, it said.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The onboarding of SHGs under the initiative has been initially piloted in the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

""The coverage shall be rapidly extended to enable a large number of SHGs from all the states/Union Territories to sell their products to government buyers. Potential buyers shall be able to search, view, cart and procure such products through the stipulated modes of procurement,"" it added.

In order to handhold and facilitate SHGs in uploading their products, GeM is assisting with product catalogue management, order fulfilment and bid participation.

Further, government buyers will also be sensitized through system generated messages/alerts in the marketplace about availability of SHG products on the portal.

Direct access to government buyers will do away with intermediaries in the supply chain, and ensure better prices for SHGs.

Rural Development and Panchayati Raj and Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar launched the initiative on Monday.

GeM is a 100 per cent government owned firm which was set up as the National Public Procurement Portal for procurement of goods and services required by central and state government organizations.

Government departments, ministries, public sector units, state governments, and Central Armed Police Forces are allowed to carry out transactions through this portal.

The government has made it mandatory for all the departments and ministries to source goods and services from the e-marketplace.

The portal provides a wide range of products from office stationery to vehicles.

Automobiles, computers and office furniture are currently the top product categories. Services, including transportation, logistics, waste management, web casting, are also listed on the portal."

UP recorded an increase of over 700 COVID-19 cases in the past one week even as the state government ramped up testing, which stood at over one lakh as on Monday. Over 1.47 lakh people have been put under home isolation.

The Taj city of Agra, where the first COVID-19 case in the state had been reported, continued to witness a sharp increase in the coronavirus positive cases. The district alone accounted for a little less than one-fourth of the total over 2700 cases in the state.

The mayor of Agra, Naveen Jain, a senior BJP leader, even said that the district could well be on the way of becoming 'Wuhan' of the country. Ironically the centre had, in the early days of Virus spread, praised what the state government had touted as the 'Agra Model' in containing the infections.

The situation in the state capital of Lucknow was no better as it was in the 'red zone'. Several areas in the city had been designated as hot spots.

Amid the rising cases of COVID-19, the expected arrival of lakhs of stranded migrant workers from different parts in the country was certain to give sleepless nights to the authorities, especially when around a dozen migrant workers, who had returned to the state before the 'Shramik Special' trains started, tested positive for Coronavirus in some districts.

All those, who tested positive, had arrived in the state from Maharashtra and Gujarat. The authorities suspect that there may be coronavirus positive cases among the migrant workers, who are returning from the special trains.

Around two lakh migrant workers and their families, who included both residents of the state and Bihar, had arrived in different parts in the state after the first lockdown was declared. The arrivals continued in the second lockdown as well.

The state government was also facing problems in accommodating such a huge number of people in the quarantine centres. Complaints of humiliation and mistreatment of the people and acute shortage of food and other eatables had poured in from different places.

UP recorded an increase of over 700 COVID-19 cases in the past one week even as the state government ramped up testing, which stood at over one lakh as on Monday. Over 1.47 lakh people have been put under home isolation.

The Taj city of Agra, where the first COVID-19 case in the state had been reported, continued to witness a sharp increase in the coronavirus positive cases. The district alone accounted for a little less than one-fourth of the total over 2700 cases in the state.

The mayor of Agra, Naveen Jain, a senior BJP leader, even said that the district could well be on the way of becoming 'Wuhan' of the country. Ironically the centre had, in the early days of Virus spread, praised what the state government had touted as the 'Agra Model' in containing the infections.

The situation in the state capital of Lucknow was no better as it was in the 'red zone'. Several areas in the city had been designated as hot spots.

Amid the rising cases of COVID-19, the expected arrival of lakhs of stranded migrant workers from different parts in the country was certain to give sleepless nights to the authorities, especially when around a dozen migrant workers, who had returned to the state before the 'Shramik Special' trains started, tested positive for Coronavirus in some districts.

All those, who tested positive, had arrived in the state from Maharashtra and Gujarat. The authorities suspect that there may be coronavirus positive cases among the migrant workers, who are returning from the special trains.

Around two lakh migrant workers and their families, who included both residents of the state and Bihar, had arrived in different parts in the state after the first lockdown was declared. The arrivals continued in the second lockdown as well.

The state government was also facing problems in accommodating such a huge number of people in the quarantine centres. Complaints of humiliation and mistreatment of the people and acute shortage of food and other eatables had poured in from different places.

Videos of the chaos and pitiable condition of the quarantine centres went viral on the social media prompting the state government to initiate a probe into the complaints."

Under this initiative, SHGs will be able to list their products on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) in five categories -- handicrafts; handloom and textiles; office accessories; grocery and pantry, and personal care and hygiene.

In the first phase, 913 SHGs from 11 states have already registered as sellers and 403 products have been onboarded, GeM said in a statement.

""A unique initiative of GeM and the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana-NRLM, the Saras Collection would showcase daily utility products made by rural self-help groups and aims to provide SHGs in rural areas with market access to government buyers,"" it said.

To develop a scalable model capable of onboarding a large number of SHGs across the country in a short time frame, GeM has developed an API (application programming interface) based integration mechanism with the NRLM (National Rural Livelihoods Mission) database, it said.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The onboarding of SHGs under the initiative has been initially piloted in the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

""The coverage shall be rapidly extended to enable a large number of SHGs from all the states/Union Territories to sell their products to government buyers. Potential buyers shall be able to search, view, cart and procure such products through the stipulated modes of procurement,"" it added.

In order to handhold and facilitate SHGs in uploading their products, GeM is assisting with product catalogue management, order fulfilment and bid participation.

Further, government buyers will also be sensitized through system generated messages/alerts in the marketplace about availability of SHG products on the portal.

Direct access to government buyers will do away with intermediaries in the supply chain, and ensure better prices for SHGs.

Rural Development and Panchayati Raj and Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar launched the initiative on Monday.

GeM is a 100 per cent government owned firm which was set up as the National Public Procurement Portal for procurement of goods and services required by central and state government organizations.

Government departments, ministries, public sector units, state governments, and Central Armed Police Forces are allowed to carry out transactions through this portal.

The government has made it mandatory for all the departments and ministries to source goods and services from the e-marketplace.

Under this initiative, SHGs will be able to list their products on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) in five categories -- handicrafts; handloom and textiles; office accessories; grocery and pantry, and personal care and hygiene.

In the first phase, 913 SHGs from 11 states have already registered as sellers and 403 products have been onboarded, GeM said in a statement.

""A unique initiative of GeM and the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana-NRLM, the Saras Collection would showcase daily utility products made by rural self-help groups and aims to provide SHGs in rural areas with market access to government buyers,"" it said.

To develop a scalable model capable of onboarding a large number of SHGs across the country in a short time frame, GeM has developed an API (application programming interface) based integration mechanism with the NRLM (National Rural Livelihoods Mission) database, it said.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The onboarding of SHGs under the initiative has been initially piloted in the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

""The coverage shall be rapidly extended to enable a large number of SHGs from all the states/Union Territories to sell their products to government buyers. Potential buyers shall be able to search, view, cart and procure such products through the stipulated modes of procurement,"" it added.

In order to handhold and facilitate SHGs in uploading their products, GeM is assisting with product catalogue management, order fulfilment and bid participation.

Further, government buyers will also be sensitized through system generated messages/alerts in the marketplace about availability of SHG products on the portal.

Direct access to government buyers will do away with intermediaries in the supply chain, and ensure better prices for SHGs.

Rural Development and Panchayati Raj and Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar launched the initiative on Monday.

GeM is a 100 per cent government owned firm which was set up as the National Public Procurement Portal for procurement of goods and services required by central and state government organizations.

Government departments, ministries, public sector units, state governments, and Central Armed Police Forces are allowed to carry out transactions through this portal.

The government has made it mandatory for all the departments and ministries to source goods and services from the e-marketplace.

The portal provides a wide range of products from office stationery to vehicles.

Automobiles, computers and office furniture are currently the top product categories. Services, including transportation, logistics, waste management, web casting, are also listed on the portal."

UP recorded an increase of over 700 COVID-19 cases in the past one week even as the state government ramped up testing, which stood at over one lakh as on Monday. Over 1.47 lakh people have been put under home isolation.

The Taj city of Agra, where the first COVID-19 case in the state had been reported, continued to witness a sharp increase in the coronavirus positive cases. The district alone accounted for a little less than one-fourth of the total over 2700 cases in the state.

The mayor of Agra, Naveen Jain, a senior BJP leader, even said that the district could well be on the way of becoming 'Wuhan' of the country. Ironically the centre had, in the early days of Virus spread, praised what the state government had touted as the 'Agra Model' in containing the infections.

The situation in the state capital of Lucknow was no better as it was in the 'red zone'. Several areas in the city had been designated as hot spots.

Amid the rising cases of COVID-19, the expected arrival of lakhs of stranded migrant workers from different parts in the country was certain to give sleepless nights to the authorities, especially when around a dozen migrant workers, who had returned to the state before the 'Shramik Special' trains started, tested positive for Coronavirus in some districts.

All those, who tested positive, had arrived in the state from Maharashtra and Gujarat. The authorities suspect that there may be coronavirus positive cases among the migrant workers, who are returning from the special trains.

Around two lakh migrant workers and their families, who included both residents of the state and Bihar, had arrived in different parts in the state after the first lockdown was declared. The arrivals continued in the second lockdown as well.

The state government was also facing problems in accommodating such a huge number of people in the quarantine centres. Complaints of humiliation and mistreatment of the people and acute shortage of food and other eatables had poured in from different places.

UP recorded an increase of over 700 COVID-19 cases in the past one week even as the state government ramped up testing, which stood at over one lakh as on Monday. Over 1.47 lakh people have been put under home isolation.

The Taj city of Agra, where the first COVID-19 case in the state had been reported, continued to witness a sharp increase in the coronavirus positive cases. The district alone accounted for a little less than one-fourth of the total over 2700 cases in the state.

The mayor of Agra, Naveen Jain, a senior BJP leader, even said that the district could well be on the way of becoming 'Wuhan' of the country. Ironically the centre had, in the early days of Virus spread, praised what the state government had touted as the 'Agra Model' in containing the infections.

The situation in the state capital of Lucknow was no better as it was in the 'red zone'. Several areas in the city had been designated as hot spots.

Amid the rising cases of COVID-19, the expected arrival of lakhs of stranded migrant workers from different parts in the country was certain to give sleepless nights to the authorities, especially when around a dozen migrant workers, who had returned to the state before the 'Shramik Special' trains started, tested positive for Coronavirus in some districts.

All those, who tested positive, had arrived in the state from Maharashtra and Gujarat. The authorities suspect that there may be coronavirus positive cases among the migrant workers, who are returning from the special trains.

Around two lakh migrant workers and their families, who included both residents of the state and Bihar, had arrived in different parts in the state after the first lockdown was declared. The arrivals continued in the second lockdown as well.

The state government was also facing problems in accommodating such a huge number of people in the quarantine centres. Complaints of humiliation and mistreatment of the people and acute shortage of food and other eatables had poured in from different places.

Videos of the chaos and pitiable condition of the quarantine centres went viral on the social media prompting the state government to initiate a probe into the complaints."

Under this initiative, SHGs will be able to list their products on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) in five categories -- handicrafts; handloom and textiles; office accessories; grocery and pantry, and personal care and hygiene.

In the first phase, 913 SHGs from 11 states have already registered as sellers and 403 products have been onboarded, GeM said in a statement.

""A unique initiative of GeM and the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana-NRLM, the Saras Collection would showcase daily utility products made by rural self-help groups and aims to provide SHGs in rural areas with market access to government buyers,"" it said.

To develop a scalable model capable of onboarding a large number of SHGs across the country in a short time frame, GeM has developed an API (application programming interface) based integration mechanism with the NRLM (National Rural Livelihoods Mission) database, it said.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The onboarding of SHGs under the initiative has been initially piloted in the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

""The coverage shall be rapidly extended to enable a large number of SHGs from all the states/Union Territories to sell their products to government buyers. Potential buyers shall be able to search, view, cart and procure such products through the stipulated modes of procurement,"" it added.

In order to handhold and facilitate SHGs in uploading their products, GeM is assisting with product catalogue management, order fulfilment and bid participation.

Further, government buyers will also be sensitized through system generated messages/alerts in the marketplace about availability of SHG products on the portal.

Direct access to government buyers will do away with intermediaries in the supply chain, and ensure better prices for SHGs.

Rural Development and Panchayati Raj and Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar launched the initiative on Monday.

GeM is a 100 per cent government owned firm which was set up as the National Public Procurement Portal for procurement of goods and services required by central and state government organizations.

Government departments, ministries, public sector units, state governments, and Central Armed Police Forces are allowed to carry out transactions through this portal.

The government has made it mandatory for all the departments and ministries to source goods and services from the e-marketplace.

Under this initiative, SHGs will be able to list their products on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) in five categories -- handicrafts; handloom and textiles; office accessories; grocery and pantry, and personal care and hygiene.

In the first phase, 913 SHGs from 11 states have already registered as sellers and 403 products have been onboarded, GeM said in a statement.

""A unique initiative of GeM and the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana-NRLM, the Saras Collection would showcase daily utility products made by rural self-help groups and aims to provide SHGs in rural areas with market access to government buyers,"" it said.

To develop a scalable model capable of onboarding a large number of SHGs across the country in a short time frame, GeM has developed an API (application programming interface) based integration mechanism with the NRLM (National Rural Livelihoods Mission) database, it said.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The onboarding of SHGs under the initiative has been initially piloted in the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

""The coverage shall be rapidly extended to enable a large number of SHGs from all the states/Union Territories to sell their products to government buyers. Potential buyers shall be able to search, view, cart and procure such products through the stipulated modes of procurement,"" it added.

In order to handhold and facilitate SHGs in uploading their products, GeM is assisting with product catalogue management, order fulfilment and bid participation.

Further, government buyers will also be sensitized through system generated messages/alerts in the marketplace about availability of SHG products on the portal.

Direct access to government buyers will do away with intermediaries in the supply chain, and ensure better prices for SHGs.

Rural Development and Panchayati Raj and Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar launched the initiative on Monday.

GeM is a 100 per cent government owned firm which was set up as the National Public Procurement Portal for procurement of goods and services required by central and state government organizations.

Government departments, ministries, public sector units, state governments, and Central Armed Police Forces are allowed to carry out transactions through this portal.

The government has made it mandatory for all the departments and ministries to source goods and services from the e-marketplace.

The portal provides a wide range of products from office stationery to vehicles.

Automobiles, computers and office furniture are currently the top product categories. Services, including transportation, logistics, waste management, web casting, are also listed on the portal."

UP recorded an increase of over 700 COVID-19 cases in the past one week even as the state government ramped up testing, which stood at over one lakh as on Monday. Over 1.47 lakh people have been put under home isolation.

The Taj city of Agra, where the first COVID-19 case in the state had been reported, continued to witness a sharp increase in the coronavirus positive cases. The district alone accounted for a little less than one-fourth of the total over 2700 cases in the state.

The mayor of Agra, Naveen Jain, a senior BJP leader, even said that the district could well be on the way of becoming 'Wuhan' of the country. Ironically the centre had, in the early days of Virus spread, praised what the state government had touted as the 'Agra Model' in containing the infections.

The situation in the state capital of Lucknow was no better as it was in the 'red zone'. Several areas in the city had been designated as hot spots.

Amid the rising cases of COVID-19, the expected arrival of lakhs of stranded migrant workers from different parts in the country was certain to give sleepless nights to the authorities, especially when around a dozen migrant workers, who had returned to the state before the 'Shramik Special' trains started, tested positive for Coronavirus in some districts.

All those, who tested positive, had arrived in the state from Maharashtra and Gujarat. The authorities suspect that there may be coronavirus positive cases among the migrant workers, who are returning from the special trains.

Around two lakh migrant workers and their families, who included both residents of the state and Bihar, had arrived in different parts in the state after the first lockdown was declared. The arrivals continued in the second lockdown as well.

The state government was also facing problems in accommodating such a huge number of people in the quarantine centres. Complaints of humiliation and mistreatment of the people and acute shortage of food and other eatables had poured in from different places.

https://www.deccanherald.com/national/spike-in-covid-19-cases-continue-in-up-returning-migrant-workers-give-officials-scare-833394.html,"As the spike in the COVID-19 cases in Uttar Pradesh continued to spike, the flood of returning migrant workers was certain to be a huge scare for the authorities in the state.

UP recorded an increase of over 700 COVID-19 cases in the past one week even as the state government ramped up testing, which stood at over one lakh as on Monday. Over 1.47 lakh people have been put under home isolation.

The Taj city of Agra, where the first COVID-19 case in the state had been reported, continued to witness a sharp increase in the coronavirus positive cases. The district alone accounted for a little less than one-fourth of the total over 2700 cases in the state.

The mayor of Agra, Naveen Jain, a senior BJP leader, even said that the district could well be on the way of becoming 'Wuhan' of the country. Ironically the centre had, in the early days of Virus spread, praised what the state government had touted as the 'Agra Model' in containing the infections.

The situation in the state capital of Lucknow was no better as it was in the 'red zone'. Several areas in the city had been designated as hot spots.

Amid the rising cases of COVID-19, the expected arrival of lakhs of stranded migrant workers from different parts in the country was certain to give sleepless nights to the authorities, especially when around a dozen migrant workers, who had returned to the state before the 'Shramik Special' trains started, tested positive for Coronavirus in some districts.

All those, who tested positive, had arrived in the state from Maharashtra and Gujarat. The authorities suspect that there may be coronavirus positive cases among the migrant workers, who are returning from the special trains.

Around two lakh migrant workers and their families, who included both residents of the state and Bihar, had arrived in different parts in the state after the first lockdown was declared. The arrivals continued in the second lockdown as well.

The state government was also facing problems in accommodating such a huge number of people in the quarantine centres. Complaints of humiliation and mistreatment of the people and acute shortage of food and other eatables had poured in from different places.

Videos of the chaos and pitiable condition of the quarantine centres went viral on the social media prompting the state government to initiate a probe into the complaints."

Under this initiative, SHGs will be able to list their products on the Government e-Marketplace (GeM) in five categories -- handicrafts; handloom and textiles; office accessories; grocery and pantry, and personal care and hygiene.

In the first phase, 913 SHGs from 11 states have already registered as sellers and 403 products have been onboarded, GeM said in a statement.

""A unique initiative of GeM and the Deen Dayal Antyodaya Yojana-NRLM, the Saras Collection would showcase daily utility products made by rural self-help groups and aims to provide SHGs in rural areas with market access to government buyers,"" it said.

To develop a scalable model capable of onboarding a large number of SHGs across the country in a short time frame, GeM has developed an API (application programming interface) based integration mechanism with the NRLM (National Rural Livelihoods Mission) database, it said.

CORONAVIRUS SPECIAL COVERAGE ONLY ON DH

The onboarding of SHGs under the initiative has been initially piloted in the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

""The coverage shall be rapidly extended to enable a large number of SHGs from all the states/Union Territories to sell their products to government buyers. Potential buyers shall be able to search, view, cart and procure such products through the stipulated modes of procurement,"" it added.

In order to handhold and facilitate SHGs in uploading their products, GeM is assisting with product catalogue management, order fulfilment and bid participation.

Further, government buyers will also be sensitized through system generated messages/alerts in the marketplace about availability of SHG products on the portal.

Direct access to government buyers will do away with intermediaries in the supply chain, and ensure better prices for SHGs.

Rural Development and Panchayati Raj and Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar launched the initiative on Monday.

GeM is a 100 per cent government owned firm which was set up as the National Public Procurement Portal for procurement of goods and services required by central and state government organizations.

Government departments, ministries, public sector units, state governments, and Central Armed Police Forces are allowed to carry out transactions through this portal.

The government has made it mandatory for all the departments and ministries to source goods and services from the e-marketplace.

The portal provides a wide range of products from office stationery to vehicles.

Automobiles, computers and office furniture are currently the top product categories. Services, including transportation, logistics, waste management, web casting, are also listed on the portal."

NEW DELHI: The government on Friday deferred the release of April GST revenue collection data as the ongoing lockdown and extended return filing deadline led to lower mop-up during the month, sources said.

The government had in March extended the deadline to file GST returns for entities with turnover of over Rs 5 crore by 15 days from the due date without payment of any late fee, interest and penalty.

However, a reduced rate of 9 per cent interest will be levied if the return is filed after May 5 till June 30.

For the business transaction in March, GST return was to be filed by April 20, which was extended till May 5.

As per convention, the government releases GST revenue collection number on the basis of cash collection in a particular month.

However, with the situation arising out of COVID-19, the government has decided to wait till the extended deadline for filing return before release of collection figure, a source said. Sources said due to the ""unprecedented situation"" arising out of the coronavirus outbreak, it has been decided to defer the April GST collection data release.

No date has yet been decided to release this data, they said.

""The government is expecting that more returns will be filed and will wait till May 5 before announcing the collection data,"" a source said, adding a decision on extension of this date will also be taken.

Businesses with turnover exceeding Rs 5 crore have to file GST return for a particular month by the 20th of the next month.

In 2019-20 fiscal, Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection had remained above the key Rs 1 lakh crore mark for 7 months out of 12.

The collection was Rs 97,597 crore in March. According to another source, low collection figure till now for April could have been the reason for deferment of GST data release on Friday.

The nationwide lockdown to contain spread of COVID-19 disease was imposed on March 25. Data released by the government on Thursday showed that output of eight core sector contracted by 6.5 per cent in March.

The real impact of the lockdown on GST revenue will be reflected in the revenue collections in May (for business activity in April) as the country was in complete lockdown last month with only essential services permitted.

Experts said the GST mop-up in May would mainly come from sectors like telecom, FMCG, food processing and pharma."
