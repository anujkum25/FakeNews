India's top health research agency on Tuesday revealed for the first time that of the total confirmed COVID-19 cases in the country 69 per cent patients have been found to be asymptomatic.

In effect, this means that nearly 7 out of 10 coronavirus patients could end up becoming silent spreaders of the infection if they are not quarantined in a facility.

Given that there are nearly 19,000 infected patients in the country, the estimation by the government suggests that about 13,000 of these people do not have any symptoms identified with the disease.

Dr RR Gangakhedkar, chief epidemiologist with the Indian Council of Medical Research, said during the daily briefing that ""most of those without symptoms were those identified through contact tracing of the positive cases.""

In India, the testing has been limited to those who have returned following international travel and have developed some symptoms, their close contacts, and healthcare workers treating confirmed COVID-19 cases.

The testing was later expanded to test all hospitalised patients with severe acute respiratory illnesses and influenza-like illnesses in hotspot areas.

Globally, it has been estimated that nearly 80 per cent of all COVID-19 patients have only mild or no symptoms and do not require hospitalisation.

Another 15 per cent are moderately sick, while only 5 per cent are likely to need ICU care. Nearly three per cent eventually succumb to the infection.

A large proportion of asymptomatic cases means that while not requiring hospital care themselves, these patients can still inadvertently spread the infection to several others -- some of whom may get severely ill.

Public health specialists meanwhile said that given that there is a big basket of symptoms related to COVID-19, apart from the classical symptoms of fever, dry cough and breathlessness, it's possible that some of them might not be documented due to lack of specific questioning of the patients.

""There are some lesser-known symptoms like gastrointestinal upset, lack of smell and headache etc that might be getting missed in rapid testing settings,"" said Dr Oommen John, public health researcher. ""The presence of a large number of infected patients with no or very mild symptoms also underlines the need to create greater awareness for reporting such cases so that they can be isolated and the outbreak can be contained."""

JAIPUR: The Rajasthan government has stopped the use of rapid test kits in the state after their accuracy rate was found to be just 5 per cent.

When doctors tested COVID-19 patients with the kits at the Sawai Mansingh (SMS) hospital in Jaipur, the results were negative in 95 percent of the cases.

A committee of experts from the Micro Biology and Medicine Department of SMS College, Jaipur, tested the kits on 100 confirmed COVID-19 patients but were shocked to find that only five of them were found positive while the other 95 were declared negative.

The committee has prescribed that PCR tests are the correct way to diagnose COVID-19 as rapid testing has turned out to be quite unreliable.

State Health Minister Raghu Sharma said, ""After the test sample results, there is a question mark over the rapid test kits. We used it in the state as per ICMR guidelines but this experiment failed completely. We were hoping that the accuracy of the test will be more than 90 percent but it was just 5 percent. We have sent the report of the results to the ICMR. If the ICMR doesn't provide any satisfactory response, we may send all these kits back,"" he said.

Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot had also stated in a video conference with the media that the purchase of the kits was done only after consulting the ICMR.

10,000 rapid test kits had initially been sent to Rajasthan, with each kit costing Rs 600. These kits are also being demanded by many other states but after the doubtful results in Rajasthan, their usefulness is under a cloud.

On Monday, 98 new COVID-19 cases were detected in Rajasthan of which 50 were in Jaipur. With this, the number of COVID-19 patients has reached 1576 in the state, while 25 people have died due to the infection. 26 districts have been hit by the virus in the state."

India's coronavirus cases breached the 1800-mark, according to the figures released by the health ministry on Tuesday evening. There are 15,122 active COVID-19 cases in the country, 603 people have died of the disease while 3,259 have been cured/ discharged.

Meanwhile, families of staff working in President's official residence advised to remain in self-isolation as mandated by the Health Ministry’s guidelines as a precautionary measure after one tested positive.

In its routine briefing, the ICMR on Monday stated that about 80% of the COVID-19 patients are showing fewer symptoms of the infection. The Health Ministry, in the same presser, mentioned that the doubling rate of the cases has gone down from 3.4 days before lockdown to 7.5 days now.

The lockdown restrictions, Ministry of Home Affairs stated, are being relaxed in various parts. However, the Centre rapped the Kerala government over the latter's decisions to open eateries and allow travel. ""Lifting of certain restrictions amounted to dilution of Centre's guidelines,"" the letter stated."

VELLORE: As many as 20 COVID-19 patients have been discharged from the Govt Vellore Medical College Hospital (GVMCH) after getting cured of the viral infection.

R Selvi, Dean of GVMCH, said, “Fifteen of the patients are from Ranipet district and five are from Tirupathur.”

The patients were given a rousing welcome by Ranipet district collector S Divyadharshini and SP A Mayilvahanan at Melvisharam while Tirupathur collector MP Sivanarul and SP P Vijayakumar received the survivors at Ambur.

Of the 15 patients belonging to Ranipet district, five are from Melvisharam, four from Wallajah, three from Kalmelkuppam and one each from Arcot, Banavaram and Ammur, officials said.

They had returned from the Tablighi Jamaat conference in Delhi.

Survivors maintained that there was no need to get bogged down by the infection. Instead people down with the virus should hold their nerves to get cured.

“There is nothing to worry about. What we need to do is to keep cool and follow the advice of the doctors,” said 55-year-old Abdul Raheem of Wallajah.

Ranipet district has reported 39 positive cases so far. The total lockdown of hotspots, as part of the containment plan, has begun to yield the desired results in checking the progress of the virus, doctors said.

Of the five patients belonging to Tirupathur district, 3 were from Ambur while Vaniyambadi and Tirupathur town accounted for one each, according to a senior officer of the health services.

He said district collector Sivanarul appealed to them to act as messengers in carrying through the message of fighting the virus to the public. He greeted the discharged patients with fruits and flowers."

KOLKATA: A day after West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee claimed she was kept in ""dark"" about the visit of central teams to assess the COVID-19 situation, the leader of one of the panels claimed the state government is not extending adequate cooperation.

The central government has constituted six Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCTs) to make an on-spot assessment of the COVID-19 situation in these places and issue necessary directions to the four states -- Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and West Bengal -- for redress.

The Union home ministry said on Monday morning the COVID-19 situation is ""especially serious"" in Mumbai, Pune, Indore, Jaipur, Kolkata and a few other places in West Bengal, and that the violation of lockdown measures risk the spread of the novel coronavirus.

Apurva Chandra, the leader of one of the two teams sent to the state, claimed its members were told they ""will not be going out"" on Tuesday.

""I had also met him yesterday. But today we have been informed that there are some issues so we are not going out today. The chief secretary is likely to visit us and we will again hold a meeting with him,"" he told a TV news channel.

Chandra said the team had made it clear that it would be moving out with state government officers in order to make the visit more productive.

""But now it is more than one day and we have only visited NICED (an ICMR facility) and the state secretariat only,"" he said.

Banerjee had on Monday expressed her displeasure in a series of tweets and sought to know the rationale behind the formation of central teams to visit the states.

She urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah to share with her the criteria to be followed by the teams for the assessment of the situation, without which her government ""would not be able to move ahead""."

LONDON: Britain is marking Queen Elizabeth II's 94th birthday with silence Tuesday, as the nation in lockdown amid the COVID-19 pandemic forgoes the usual gun salutes and ringing of bells.

With thousands dead amid the outbreak, the monarch decided that the celebratory display of military firepower would not be appropriate. Nor will there be a celebratory peal of bells at Westminster Abbey, as the church where the queen was married and crowned is currently closed.

The royal family took to social media to share images of Elizabeth as she marks the occasion — but in keeping with social distancing rules, there will be no visits.

The queen will mark the day with her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, 98, at Windsor Castle in Berkshire."

PARIS: The coronavirus pandemic is exacerbating threats to press freedom around the world, with authoritarian states including China and Iran suppressing details of the outbreak, activists said on Tuesday.

Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) said in its annual press freedom rankings the pandemic was ""highlighting and amplifying the many crises"" already casting a shadow on press freedom.

The outbreak had encouraged some regimes to ""take advantage of the fact people are stunned and mobilisation has weakened to impose measures that would be impossible to adopt in normal times"", RSF secretary general Christophe Deloire told AFP.

The rankings saw few major changes from last year, with Nordic countries regarded as the most free and isolated states Turkmenistan and North Korea footing the list of 180 countries.

RSF accused China and Iran -- in 177th and 173rd place respectively -- of censoring major coronavirus outbreaks.

Alluding to accusations that Beijing concealed the initial extent of the outbreak, it said China ""maintains its system of information hyper-control, whose negative effects for the entire world have been seen during the coronavirus public health crisis"".

Europe has also not been immune -- Hungary, under Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has passed a special law on false information which was a ""completely disproportionate and coercive measure"".

RSF said there was a ""clear correlation"" between suppression of media freedom in response to the coronavirus pandemic and a country's ranking in the index.

While Norway topped the index for the fourth year in a row, Finland was again the runner-up.

North Korea took last position from Turkmenistan, and Eritrea continued to be Africa's lowest-ranked country at number 178.

The third biggest leap was by Sudan, which rose 16 places to 159th after the removal of president Omar al-Bashir.

France lost two places to rank 32nd, with journalists in the country sometimes the victims of police violence at demonstrations, it said.

Published annually by RSF since 2002, the World Press Freedom Index assesses factors such as media independence, self-censorship, the legal framework and transparency based on a questionnaire filled out by experts.

Turkey, where President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has been repeatedly criticised for cracking down on press freedom, rose three places to 154th but RSF said this was because of ""other countries falling"" rather than positive change.

It said censorship of the media, especially online media, has been stepped up in Turkey and the country was ""more authoritarian than ever.""

Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, in 149th place, is also persevering ""efforts to control the Internet, using ever more elaborate methods"", it said, citing a law that would allow the country to disconnect the Russian internet from the rest of the world.

""The prospect of a Chinese-style scenario (in Russia) is alarming,"" RSF said.

RSF said ""the closure of the national internet"" is already a reality in the isolated Central Asian state of Turkmenistan where the few internet users can access only a highly censored version of the Internet, often in cafes where they have to show ID before connecting.

""Almost everywhere in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, strongmen are consolidating their grip on news and information,"" RSF said."

BHOPAL: Two more Bhopal gas tragedy victims succumbed to coronavirus, taking the total number of such deaths in the Madhya Pradesh capital to seven, an official said on Tuesday.

A 70-year-old gas mishap survivor died on April 17 while another 60-year-old tragedy victim died on April 14, Rachna Dhingra, of the NGO Bhopal Group for Information and Action which is working for the gas mishap victims, told PTI.

Samples of both the victims came out positive for coronavirus after their death, she said.

Survivors of the 1984 toxic gas tragedy are more vulnerable to the coronavirus infection and need special care, she said.

Earlier this month, five victims of the gas leak had died due to the coronavirus disease here.

The Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Center (BMHRC), a dedicated facility for the treatment of gas mishap survivors, was recently turned into a medical facility for coronavirus patients, causing hardship to these people.

However, after the outrage over the five deaths, the government against classified BMHRC as a facility for the gas tragedy victims.

The first coronavirus victim from Bhopal, a 55-year- old man, died at a city hospital on April 5, Dhingra said.

Another 80-year-old gas tragedy victim, who was a retired employee of the Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), died on April 8 and his sample came out positive for coronavirus on April 11, she said.

Besides, a 40-year-old gas tragedy victim, who was suffering from oral cancer for more than a year, died on April 12 and his sample test report later came out positive for coronavirus, she said.

Another 52-year-old gas mishap survivor, who suffered from a permanent injury, had history of tuberculosis.

He recently tested positive for coronavirus and died on his way to the COVID-19 ward at Hamidia hospital, she said.

Also, a 75-year-old senior journalist, who survived the gas tragedy, died on April 11 and his sample test report came out positive for coronavirus on April 14, she said.

On March 21, some organisations working for the welfare of gas tragedy survivors wrote to the state and central authorities concerned, saying an overwhelming number of gas victims suffer from respiratory, cardiovascular, kidney problems and cancer as a result of exposure to the toxic gas that leaked at the Union Carbide factory here in 1984.

They claimed that these survivors were at least five times more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other people and therefore, need special care.

According to the state health bulletin, Bhopal has so far reported seven deaths due to COVID-19.

All the deceased were gas tragedy victims, Dhingra said."

CHENNAI: A group of people who have recovered after having tested positive for the Novel Coronavirus upon their return from the Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Delhi have come forward to donate their plasma for the plasma therapy clinical trial in the State.

The main reason they said, apart from their wish to help critically ill patients, was to counter the 'baseless accusations' hurled against them ever since a large number of those who attended the Islamic gathering tested positive.

A thirty-eight year old businessman Mohammad Abbas from Tiruppur was discharged from the ESI hospital in Coimbatore on Sunday.

""As soon as I got discharged, I met the district administration officials and the dean of the hospital and told them that they may contact me anytime if they needed me to donate my plasma,"" he told Express.

""It has only been one day since I was discharged but I've already spoken to others (from the Jamaat) who have recovered and they were all ready to donate,"" he added.

Plasma therapy is the process of collecting the plasma from those fully recovered from COVID-19 and using it to help patients who are currently suffering from the infection. Those that have fully recovered are said to have COVID-19 antibodies in their plasma that may help facilitate recovery of those critically ill from the virus.

Muhammed Usman Ali from Theni who also recovered from the virus told Express, ""I was asymptomatic but got myself tested after the Jamaat told us that all of us should. It turned out that I was positive but I fought off the virus and have bounced back stronger than before. If the Government calls for us, we will all be there to donate our plasma.""

""There are about 42 people that I know of across the State who are willing to donate,"" he added.

Sulthan from Chennai, an electrical engineer at a private firm, coordinated with Delhi returnees from across the State for this initiative although he was not among those who went to Delhi for the gathering.

""Ever since it emerged that many among those who returned from Delhi tested positive, some sections have taken it upon themselves to instigate hatred towards Muslims rather than create awareness about the virus,"" he said.

""Initially some of them were scared since they didn't know about plasma therapy but after I explained to them, almost everyone said they were ready,"" he added.

The fact that many have voluntarily come forward to donate the plasma shows that they never intended to deliberately spread the virus as some people say, said the Nawab of Arcot, Mohammed Abdul Ali.

""Islam says that we have to be loyal to the Government in whichever country that we reside. The entire religion cannot be blamed for the pandemic in this country; this is the work of certain mischief-mongers,"" he said.

He commended those who have come forward to donate their plasma saying that it shows their sincerity and honesty.

""However, I appeal to my Muslim brethren to refrain from going to mosques for special prayers throughout the month of Ramadan even if the lockdown is lifted,"" he said.

""God forbid, if the virus appears again, it will be called the 'Ramadan virus' and the blame will again fall on them,"" he added.

https://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2020/apr/21/covid-19-gujarat-hospital-develops-device-to-boost-capacity-of-ventilators-2133268.html,"By PTI

AHMEDABAD: A kidney hospital here in Gujarat has developed a multiplexer device to augment the capacity of ventilators, which are in great demand in view of the rising number of coronavirus cases.

Designed and developed by the Ahmedabad-based Institute of Kidney Diseases and Research Centre (IKDRC), the four-way multiplexer splits oxygen supply from a single- source ventilator to four patients through inspiratory limbs or pipes simultaneously.

Similarly, the expiratory limbs or pipes take back exhalation from the patient and merge into another set of multiplexer connected with the ventilator machine, IKDRC Director Dr Vineet Mishra said.

""If there is a sudden rush of coronavirus patients for ventilatory support, then the use of multiplexer increases the capacity of machines available. Using this simple device, one ventilator can be used for four patients,"" he said.

It is not an ideal way but a practical solution to address any future emergency, Mishra said.

Ventilators with higher capacity of tidal volume can be used to provide support to as many as eight patients from a single machine by adding extra set of multiplexers, he said.

""If not ideal, it is certainly a better ventilation support technique than the manual AMBU bag resuscitators, he said, adding that the technique has been favoured by various hospitals in the US to handle the rise in a number of COVID-19 patients.

Through this technique, the oxygenation levels and volume for all four patients could be maintained by adjusting the tidal volume level of the ventilator machine in use, without compromising on the quality of the ventilatory support offered, the official said.

In the COVID-19 infection, the virus severely breaks down the red blood cells (RBCs), which in-turn develop clots that further block alveolar (air sacs) of the lungs, a pneumonic condition, he explained.

Such patients require 24-hour ventilatory support to fight back the pneumonic condition as along as the virus intensity remains high, Mishra said.

The idea to develop a homegrown multiplexer was conceived after observing the trends and analysing the empirical data of COVID-19 patients for ventilatory support in the intensive care units (ICU) across Europe and US-based hospitals, he added.

KANNUR: Nightingale -19, the robot designed by students of Vimal Jyothi Engineering College, Chemperi, with the support of the health department, joined the district’s fight against COVID on Monday.

The robot will be used to serve food and water to patients admitted in isolation wards. Health Minister KK Shailaja inaugurated Nightingale-19 from Thiruvananthapuram through a video conference.

“Ever since we heard about robots being used in Wuhan by China’s health department, we had been considering introducing robots here. That is when engineering students of Vimal Jyothi came forward with this wonderful invention,” said Dr C Ajith Kumar, nodal officer of COVID treatment centre, Ancharakkandi Medical College Hospital.

Nightingale-19 will be very useful for Anjarakandy Medical College Hospital, as it is the centre where the most number of positive cases are being treated, he added.

In China, the robot was used for serving food and water only. Here, however, patients can communicate with their doctors and nurses through the specially designed video display system.

“Though there are two robots, only one will be operational as the other has some technical snags to be corrected,” said Dr Ajith.

The robot has the capacity to carry food and water for six persons or up to 25kg. It can be controlled using a remote even from a distance of one kilometre.

After every trip, the robot will be disinfected, he said. District Medical Office K Narayana Naik, District Health Mission programme manager Dr K V Latheesh, District Surveillance Officer Dr M K Shaj and Dr C Ajith Kumar participated in the inaugural ceremony."

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The UK has so far witnessed more than 16,000 deaths due to COVID- 19 pandemic in hospitals alone.

Dr Ajikumar Kavidasan, a Malayali chest physician and an interventional pulmonologist attached to Croydon University Hospital (CUH) under National Health Service (NHS) Trust in London and his team of pulmonologists have a tough task ahead as several scores of Corona -19 suspects are making a beeline for their consultation daily.

Braving all odds, Alappuzha native Dr Aji has been on a path-breaking recovery trail. With more than 1.2 lakh confirmed COVID-19 cases in UK, it's capital city London is showing the maximum number of cases. CUH, which is like a district general hospital based in South London, has so far witnessed 120 COVID- 19 deaths which include a 13-year-old girl. It has not been easy for Dr Ajikumar and his team of five doctors to combat the coronavirus with no treatment protocol available initially.

Dr Ajikumar, who is the head of the respiratory medicine at CUH, himself sees close to fifty COVID-19 patients a day wherein the majority of them turn out to be positive.

He told TNIE that his major finding is that those affected with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has fairly no chance of contracting coronavirus. “It may be because of previous multiple infections and careful self-isolation these patients have been practising.

The most affected with coronavirus are mostly healthy people who are around 50 years of age and have already hypertension and diabetes,” said 50- year-old Dr Ajikumar, a former student of TD Medical College, Alappuzha.

For Dr Ajikumar, life has always been complex and he feels that it is his fighting skills which have kept him in good stead so far.

His school days at Mangalam Government High School at Arattupuzha was not so rosy where he had to run back and forth dozens of times from his parents’ wayside teashop to the public tap.

After filling all the tubs with water, he will help his parents, Kavidasan and Tulasi Bai, to prepare steam cake (puttu) and chickpeas curry at the wayside eatery near TD Medical College. Sheer hard work and determination helped him pursue his studies from the same medical college.

He said that people in the UK took the pandemic seriously only after their Prime Minister Boris Johnson was confirmed COVID-19 positive.

Dr Ajikumar feels that if the UK too had emulated the lockdown like his native country, things wouldn’t have gone awry there.

Arattupuzha native Dr Ajikumar is determined to see a good outcome after his team prepared a recovery trial to combat the deadly virus through a combination of hydroxychloroquine, Beta interferon and high-dose steroids where its success rate is still in the preliminary stages."

A crisis is like a wind. It separates the chaff from the grain. Till then, they seem similar. The need to separate them is keenest with regard to sowing. The key difference between chaff and grain is that the former is irrelevant to human needs.

My attention was drawn the other day to the ‘feet-washing ceremony’ conducted in a church in Kerala, commemorating what Jesus did at the Last Supper. He washed the feet of his disciples to cure them of disease endemic in humans: a vainglorious obsession with hierarchy. Jesus washed their feet, not because their feet were stinking, but because something was rotting in their souls. It was anything but a ritual. It was a spiritual surgery. But priests are at home only in rituals. So, for centuries this soul-surgery of feet-washing had been degraded into a priestly ritual, not only emptying it of its ethical significance but also contaminating it with priestly hypocrisy. Feet-washing is the last thing a bishop or priest would do, if he can help it.

All the same, it has become a priestly addiction. But its indulgence this year is upstaged by the virus. Human feet are not available to be washed. Never mind, a way out can be found: wash the feet of dolls! Once meaning is drained out of a ritual, only its mechanism remains. It makes little difference if the feet washed is organic or plastic. On Maundy Thursday, a certain number of feet must be washed. They have been. Ask the dolls, if you can’t believe this.

I would have overlooked this as an isolated instance of priestly stupidity, but for the massive unmaking of religion happening through the present pandemic. Maulana Saad of Tablighi Jamaat, who exhorted his followers to defy pandemic-related regulations and assemble in Delhi, represents not a lunatic fringe of religion, but its priestly mainstream. The difference between him and his counterparts in Islam and other religions is the degree of impudence. The Maulana vanished promptly to avoid unpleasantness to himself. But for the fear of consequences, it is very likely, as some Christian priests have proved in the US, that many more religious bigots would advocate something similar.

Whether it be the laughable feet-washing of dolls in Kerala, or the suicidal advocacy of religious recklessness in Tablighi Markaz in Delhi, or the fraudulent claims of religious godmen that they had received divine revelations about the pandemic way back in 2018, the common denominator of

present-day religiosity is the redundancy that its stockists and retailers face. They find themselves all of a sudden in a situation of specific needs. A world of fear and suffering has opened up. A golden opportunity has come calling to silence cynics and mockers of religion. But the salesmen and CEOs of the multi-national religious industry are nowhere to be seen. The pandemic is proving a furnace in which the chaff of religious fraud is being incinerated.

When the virus reached the US, I was excited; for the most potent godman—certainly, the richest—of our times live there. He goes by the name of Benny Hinn and has visited India also to showcase his supernatural powers. With a single swish of his hand, he causes hundreds of people to fall unconscious. They come up healed of everything! What is a fragile virus before such a mighty man, rippling with the power of God? But curiously, he has gone into hiding when he is needed most. Not a single faith-healer is in sight anywhere in India, the land of religions. Only poorly paid priests are in business, belabouring dead horses of rituals that have been drained of spiritual vitality and experiential truth a long time ago. They are doing their best to edify and fortify the faithful.

Now compare them with health workers in this country and elsewhere. They are the heroes of our times. They risk their life for others, undeterred even by sporadic eruptions of ingratitude from the very people they serve. This is nothing new. Albert Camus, to take a random example, has structured The Plague on this contrast.

In that novel, at the outbreak of the Plague in Oran, Dr. Rieux gives himself wholeheartedly to the service of the suffering people. In contrast, Father Paneloux, the scholarly priest who represents the best that ritual-laden religion could offer in the context, gives a fire and brimstone sermon. He grabs the outbreak of the Plague as the opportunity of a lifetime to preach repentance and to kindle in the religiously lukewarm people a new fervour for the church. He portrays the Plague as the outworking of God’s wrath upon the city for its irreligion. He claims to have seen in vision angels of retribution hovering over homes to strike them with death for their immorality.

What does Fr. Paneloux contribute to the life of the people? He aggravates their anxiety and drives quite a few over the edge. “The people felt that they had been sentenced, for an unknown crime, for an indeterminate period of punishment … They became aware that they were undergoing a sort of incarceration under the blue dome of sky.” The irony that Albert Camus underlines is strikingly relevant to our context. The venerable priest, for all his religious resourcefulness, is ridiculously irrelevant to the given context. Loving religion to the point of becoming callous towards fellow humans, custodians of religion prove an added pestilence. It was this aberration that made Jesus say to the priests of his day, “Physicians, heal yourselves.”

COLOMBO: Sri Lanka has postponed the parliamentary elections by nearly two months to June 20 due to the coronavirus outbreak that has killed seven people and infected 295 others in the island nation.

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on March 2 dissolved the Parliament, six months ahead of schedule and called a snap election on April 25.

A gazette notice signed by the three members of the National Election Commission announcing June 20 date of the election was issued on Monday.

The decision was taken after much deliberation with health and security authorities.

The EC has written to President Rajapaksa asking him to seek the highest court's opinion on a possible constitutional standoff arising from the postponement of the election.

It said that the postponement meant that parliament would not be able to meet on June 2, which is three months from the dismissal of last parliament on March 2.

However, Rajapaksa asserted that it was the election commission's job to fix the polls date and as such no need for the Supreme Court's intervention.

Earlier, the election commission met with the government officials and reviewed the pandemic situation affecting the election machinery.

On Monday, the government dropped its decision to relax the nationwide curfew and extended it to April 27 following a sudden spike of 41 coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours.

On Sunday, the government announced to partially lift the curbs from Monday to boost economic activity.

The island nation has been under a 24-hour curfew since March 20 to combat the deadly viral infection.

All opposition parties and many civil society groups have urged the government to show caution in trying to rush through holding the election.

Sri Lanka has so far reported 295 COVID-19 cases, including seven deaths, and 96 recoveries, since the first viral infection was reported in the country on March 11.

The parliamentary polls were announced 6 months ahead of the schedule as Rajapaksa, who was elected as president in November, wanted a new Parliament to implement his mandate.

Rajapaksa is also under pressure to re-summon the dissolved Parliament in order to approve finances for government business from May.

The country's Constitution stipulates that a dissolved Parliament must be replaced within three months.

The deadline had been June 2.

The previous Parliament had approved funds till April 30."

BANGKOK: The World Health Organization said Tuesday that rushing to ease coronavirus restrictions will likely lead to a resurgence of the illness, a warning that comes as governments start rolling out plans to get their economies up and running again.

“This is not the time to be lax. Instead, we need to ready ourselves for a new way of living for the foreseeable future,” said Dr. Takeshi Kasai, the WHO regional director for the Western Pacific.

He said governments must remain vigilant to stop the spread of the virus and the lifting of lockdowns and other social distancing measures must be done gradually and strike the right balance between keeping people healthy and allowing economies to function.

Despite concerns from health officials, some U.S. states on Monday announced aggressive reopening plans, while Boeing and at least one other U.S. heavy-equipment manufacturer resumed production. Elsewhere around the world, step-by-step reopenings were underway in Europe, where the crisis has begun to ebb in places such as Italy, Spain and Germany.

Australia said Tuesday that it will allow the resumption of non-urgent surgeries from next week as health authorities grow more confident that hospitals there won’t be overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients.

The reopenings come as politicians grow weary of soaring unemployment numbers and the prospect of economic depression. Asian shares followed Wall Street lower on Tuesday after U.S. oil futures plunged below zero because of a worldwide glut as factories, automobiles and airplanes sit idled.

The cost to have a barrel of U.S. crude delivered in May plummeted to negative $37.63 as traders run out of places to store it. It was at roughly $60 at the start of the year.

Businesses that start operating again in the U.S. are likely to engender good will with President Donald Trump at a time when his administration is doling out billions in relief to companies. Trump has been agitating to restart the economy, singling out Democratic-led states and egging on protesters complaining that the shutdowns are destroying their livelihoods and trampling their rights.

In several states — most of them Republican-led — governors said they had seen signs that the coronavirus curve was flattening, making it possible to start reopening businesses and public spaces.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced plans to restart his state’s economy before the end of the week. Kemp said gyms, hair salons, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors could reopen Friday, as long as owners followed strict social distancing and hygiene requirements.

Texas on Monday began a week of slow reopenings, starting off with state parks, while officials said that later in the week, stores would be allowed to offer curbside service. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee announced that businesses across most of the state would begin reopening as early as next week, although the order did not cover counties with the largest cities, including Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga. Both states are led by Republicans.

Republican West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Monday that he would allow hospitals to begin performing elective procedures if the facilities met an unspecified set of criteria, while Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Monday that he would let his statewide stay-at-home order expire next week as long as strict social distancing and other individual protective measures continued.

But governors from many other states said they lacked the testing supplies they need and warned they could get hit by a second wave of infections, given how people with no symptoms can still spread the disease.

“Who in this great state actually believes that they care more about jet skiing than saving the lives of the elderly or the vulnerable?” Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer remarked, referring to restrictions in place in her state. “This action isn’t about our individual right to gather. It’s about our parents’ right to live.”

Boeing said it was putting about 27,000 people back to work this week building passenger jets at its Seattle-area plants, with virus-slowing precautions in place, including face masks and staggered shifts. Boeing’s shutdown went into effect March 25 after workers tested positive for the virus and an inspector for the company died. Washington was the first state to see a spike in COVID-19 cases and enacted strict shutdown orders that helped tamp down the virus.

Doosan Bobcat, a farm equipment maker and North Dakota’s largest manufacturer, said about 2,200 workers at three factories around the state returned. Company spokeswoman Stacey Breuer said the reopening came after two weeks spent putting in safety measures.

“There is definitely still some concern and do we feel 100% safe? Obviously not,” said William Wilkinson, a Bobcat welder and president of a United Steelworkers union local. He said workers there were wearing face masks and keeping their distance from one another.

Worldwide the virus has infected nearly 2.5 million people and caused more than 170,000 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University count. The U.S. has been the hardest hit country with more than 787,000 infections and more than 42,000 deaths.

The true figures are believed to be much higher, in part because of limited testing and difficulties in counting the dead.

There have been encouraging signs in places like New York state, where hospitalizations have leveled off. Monday’s death toll, at 478, was the lowest in three weeks, down from a peak of nearly 800.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert, warned on ABC: “Unless we get the virus under control, the real recovery economically is not going to happen.”"

KARIMNAGAR: In a positive trend, the number of fresh COVID-19 cases being reported in Karimnagar seems to have gradually reduced with the district reporting only two active cases on Sunday, as opposed to the earlier 19.

The district was on tenterhooks from the time a group of eight Indonesian preachers tested positive, forcing officials to seal many areas and begin primary contact tracing on a war-footing. The situation worsened when four people tested positive at Karimnagar and Huzurabad towns after returning from the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi.

But, things improved, with all the coronavirus-positive primary contacts cured and those who returned from the Tablighi Jammaat meeting also discharged on Sunday. These patients were in home quarantine for 14 days, District Medical and Health Officer (DMHO) Dr G Sujatha said.

Strict implementation of lockdown

Compared to other districts, the number of positive cases being reported in Karimnagar is gradually decreasing. This was because authorities were focusing on social distancing, tracing patients’ travel history, implementing the lockdown strictly and ensuring people practise self-restriction.

Municipal corporation authorities set up vegetable markets at 15 areas and mobile vegetable vans were doing the rounds so that people did not have to commute long distances to buy essentials. Disinfection and special sanitation drives were also being conducted.

Cops leave no stone unturned

Meanwhile, police were using drone cameras and mobile command control rooms to keep an eye on people gathering in large numbers. They booked several people for violating the lockdown rules. For instance, it booked one person for spitting at Huzurabad.

It also booked a Blue Colt personnel on Sunday for not informing the command and control wing about a social distancing violation. The Health department was also surveying containment zones every day to check for any suspected cases. Health screenings were being conducted at markets and check-post areas too. Medical teams were inspecting and enquiring about patients in home quarantine on a daily basis.

THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: The government’s decision to kickstart the economy by easing restrictions saw many people crowding at markets and public places on Monday. Alarmed at the public’s response, health experts said easing the restrictions will create more obstacles in the state’s efforts to contain the spread of coronavirus.

Public health experts have also asked the government to conduct rapid antibody screening and heat map analysis before opening businesses.

They said that taking the foot off the brake at a crucial juncture will do more harm than good. Singapore and Japan, which lifted the restrictions after witnessing a slump in cases, are now dealing with a new wave of COVID-19 infections, they pointed out. It’s reliably learnt that the public health experts of the health department were not taken into confidence before deciding to ease the restrictions.

“The public’s response was not at all encouraging. The containment measures like social distancing and wearing of facemasks were flouted at many places. Hence, the government should reconsider the decision,” said a health department officer.

People thronging roads, markets and other public spaces without following the safety norms could jeopardise state government’s achievement and will put the efforts to flatten the curve in a precarious position, health experts warn.

“It is a fact that the number positive cases are plummeting and more patients are getting discharged from the hospital. But that doesn’t mean that the state is free from the COVID-19 threat. It remains unknown whether the state has any asymptomatic case or silent spreader. The chances of re-infection are also there,” added the officer.

At the same time, sources say that the decision to bring in some relaxations was not of a collective one as public health experts and epidemiologists were kept in the dark.

“Neither the country nor the state could remain in a lockdown forever. But a misstep at this time has the potentiality to become deadly. A spike in cases, especially in a society with a good number of aged population and with comorbidities like cancer, respiratory illness, diabetes and others, will overwhelm the health system. The result will be a catastrophe beyond imagination,” said a representative of the Kerala Government Medical Officers’ Association.

The public health experts are of the opinion that the state government should make informed decisions and not out of the current trend of viral transmission. According to them, it will be too early to loosen the lockdown.

BHUBANESWAR: West Bengal seems to have become a cause of serious concern for the State Government as a third of COVID-19 positive cases are directly linked to it. Even as the State witnessed a surge in COVID cases on Monday, of the 13 persons who tested positive in the last 24 hours, 10, including five each from Jajpur and Bhadrak districts, have been found to be returnees from West Bengal. As high as 32 per cent of cases in Odisha have their origin in WB.

State chief spokesperson on COVID-19 Subroto Bagchi said it is a big worry for the Government as of 74 positive cases, 24 are related to the neighbouring state. “They have either returned from the state or have come in contact with the returnees. Collectors of the districts concerned have been asked to properly inquire into the cases and take immediate containment measures,” he said. If official sources are to be believed, the five of Jajpur were a part of six-member group that had travelled from Badabazaar in Howrah in a van on March 29 when the lockdown was in force.

Similarly, the other five of Bhadrak had returned from WB in another vehicle. They are among 132 persons who have been traced to have returned from WB and kept in institutional quarantine at their respective block headquarters. Most of the cases with origin from WB have been identified by panchayats that in turn informed the district administration and put them in quarantine.

“Since it is not possible for the State or district administration and police to keep watch on every village, panchayats are extremely important in detection of potential cases. Community based surveillance can help fight coronavirus,” Bagchi said. The State Government has urged all people with travel history to the neighbouring state during the last 28 days to inform local sarpanch, block development officer or tehsildar and quarantine themselves at home. Meanwhile, the border villagers have demanded the Government to intensify surveillance on the connecting routes to check movement of people from Bengal."

NEW DELHI: The Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party government announced that the Azadpur wholesale market will operate round-the-clock from Tuesday.

Though the government reasoned that the decision was taken to ensure enough supply of vegetables and fruits in the city, the move could potentially backfire given that Delhi is trying to flatten the coronavirus curve through a lockdown.

Keeping in mind the fragile situation, the administration will restrict entry through coupons to 1,000 people at the mandi at a time only to avoid large crowding at Asia’s largest fruit and vegetable market. ""The Azadpur Mandi caters to the people and procures produce from farmers across the country. There was a decline in the supply of fruits and vegetables from the market. To eradicate all such issues, it was decided that the mandi will remain open for 24 hours,"" Cabinet Minister Gopal Rai said on Monday.

While farm arrivals in the market nearly dropped by 50 per cent post-lockdown, prices of fruits and vegetables had shot up as a result in the city. Farmers were also facing trouble in supplying their farm produce due to the odd-even scheme as well as the restriction of movement.

Recently, Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) of the Azadpur wholesale market had announced implementation of the Odd-Even rule. Social distancing norms were ordered and a full body sanitiser was installed at the entrance gate for disinfecting those arriving at the mandi.

""Vegetables and fruits will be sold from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. Every 4 hours, the entry of 1000 people will be allowed through the coupons. From 10 p.m. till 6 a.m, trucks will be allowed to enter and leave the market,"" Rai asserted.

The government has been making arrangements to ensure hygiene and sanitation in the area, he said. ""For this purpose, 600 sanitation workers will be deployed. Monitoring in-charges have been appointed to ensure smooth functioning of the market. I have held meetings with the traders and they were told to maintain social distancing at all costs,"" the minister added.

Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (Azadpur) chairman Adil Ahmad Khan said 600 sanitation workers have been engaged for cleanliness. Similarly, 900 civil defence volunteers will ensure social-distancing at the wholesale market. “We have also requested the Delhi Police to deploy two battalion at the Mandi,” he told the media. The rules of one truck per trader has been withdrawn following the demands of the traders, the official said.

No exclusive timings for vegetable, fruit sale

The committee’s recent decision to allow sale of vegetables from 6 am to 11 am and fruits from 2 pm to 6 pm has been revoked. Fruits and vegetables will be now available from morning 6am to 10 pm at night in the wholesale market, the senior mandi official said."

https://www.newindianexpress.com/lifestyle/tech/2020/apr/18/covid-19-facebook-to-warn-users-who-liked-coronavirus-hoaxes-2131672.html,"By Associated Press

Facebook will soon let you know if you shared or interacted with dangerous coronavirus misinformation on the site, the latest in a string of aggressive efforts the social media giant is taking to contain an outbreak of viral falsehoods.

The new notice will be sent to users who have clicked on, reacted to, or commented on posts featuring harmful or false claims about COVID-19 after they have been removed by moderators. The alert, which will start appearing on Facebook in the coming weeks, will direct users to a site where the World Health Organization lists and debunks virus myths and rumors.

Facebook, Google and Twitter are introducing stricter rules, altered algorithms and thousands of fact checks to stop the spread of bad misinformation online about the virus.

Challenges remain. Tech platforms have sent home human moderators who police the platforms, forcing them to rely on automated systems to take down harmful content. They are also up against people’s mistrust of authoritative sources for information, such as the WHO.

“Through this crisis, one of my top priorities is making sure that you see accurate and authoritative information across all of our apps,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on his Facebook page Thursday.

The company disclosed Thursday that it put more than 40 million warning labels in March over videos, posts or articles about the coronavirus that fact-checking organizations have determined are false or misleading. The number includes duplicate claims — the labels were based on 4,000 fact checks.

Facebook says those warning labels have stopped 95% of users from clicking on the false information.

“It’s a big indicator that people are trusting the fact checkers,” said Baybars Orsek, the director of the International Fact-Checking Network. “The label has an impact on people’s information consumption.”

But Orsek cautioned that the data Facebook provided should be reviewed by outside editors or experts, and called on the historically secretive company to release regular updates about the impact of its fact-checking initiative.

Orsek’s organization is a nonprofit that certifies news organizations as fact checkers, a requirement to produce fact-checking articles for Facebook. Facebook has recruited dozens of news organizations around the globe to fact check bad information on its site. The Associated Press is part of that program.

Facebook will also begin promoting the articles that debunk COVID-19 misinformation, of which there are thousands, on a new information center called “Get The Facts.” Putting trustworthy information in front of people can be just as useful, if not more, than simply debunking falsehoods.

Still, conspiracy theories, claims about unverified treatments, and misinformation about coronavirus vaccines continue to pop up on the site daily— sometimes circumventing the safeguards Facebook has implemented.

The new notification feature also only applies to posts on users' main news feed — not in groups, where misinformation often spreads unchecked, and not on WhatsApp or Instagram, though Facebook has put some other protections in place on those platforms.

That means a lot of users won't get the new alert from Facebook, said Stephanie Edgerly, an associate professor at Northwestern University who researches audience engagement. She said many users might simply see a false claim in their Facebook feed but not share, like or comment on it.

“A lot of what we know about how people scroll through their news feed not clicking on things, they still reading posts or headlines, without clicking on the link,” Edgerly said.

Facebook users, for example, viewed a false claim that the virus is destroyed by chlorine dioxide nearly 200,000 times, estimates a new study out today from Avaaz, a left-leaning advocacy group that tracks and researches online misinformation.

The group found more than 100 pieces of misinformation about the coronavirus on Facebook, viewed millions of times even after the claims had been marked as false or misleading by fact checkers. Other false claims were not labeled as misinformation, despite being declared by fact-checkers as false.

“Coronavirus misinformation content mutates and spreads faster than Facebook’s current system can track it,” Avaaz said in its report.

This is especially problematic for Italian and Spanish misinformation, the report said, because Facebook has been slower to issue warning labels on posts that aren't in English. Avaaz also noted that it can take as long as 22 days for Facebook to label misinformation as such — giving it plenty of time to spread.

False claims about coronavirus treatments have had deadly consequences.

Last month, Iranian media reported more than 300 people had died and 1,000 were sickened in the country after ingesting methanol, a toxic alcohol rumored to be a remedy through private social media messages."

These days Pawan Arora’s favourite subject is sleep. The countrywide lockdown following the coronavirus outbreak has ensured that Arora spends most of his day in his favourite part of the house—bedroom. Arora, who otherwise gives commerce lessons to undergraduates in a government college, now spends most of his day on his new mattress catching up on all his lost sleep.

He is the proud owner of a ‘smart’ mattress that relieved him of his sleep issues and set him back by Rs 34,900, an ‘investment for health’ in his words. ""I was suffering from back pain and it was affecting my sleep. One of my doctors suggested that I change my mattress. After several months of research, I chanced on the Smart Grid technology and zeroed in on the company that used it in their mattresses in India,"" says Arora, a resident of Jalalabad in Punjab.

He contacted The Sleep Company, a Mumbai-based startup, and asked them for testimonials. They sent across videos of happy customers and patiently answered his every query for over two months. They also offered a 100-day trial offer wherein a refund was assured in case the company failed on its promise. ""I bought the Smart Grid mattress in December. I no longer listen to any soothing music before hitting the bed. My mattress has given me a new lease of sleep,"" says the 50-year-old.

Like everything else, sleep is now a commodity, and Arora is among the growing breed of Indians who are spending money to ensure quality sleep. And there’s reason to it. Last month, when Wakefit, a Bengaluru-based sleep solutions provider, released its annual Great Indian Sleep Scorecard 2020 report, it found that one in five Indians felt they suffered from insomnia. Of the 50,000 responses collected for the study, 54 percent said they indulged in social media and over-the-top (OTT) platforms late into the night, a 2x increase over last year.

Sleep doctors find the results hardly surprising. “We have a new ambitious young India with a huge middle class population aspiring to have it all and do it all, putting in less sleep hours because of longer working hours and increased screen time or illicit lifestyle habits,” says Dr Srikanta JT, Consultant—Paediatric Pulmonology and Sleep Medicine, Aster CMI Hospital, Bengaluru.

Also in the wake of Covid-19, sleep is one among the long list of things that has lost its usual trajectory. When a netizen asked K Taraka Rama Rao, Telangana’s IT minister, if he is getting adequate sleep as he is active on Twitter 24/7, the minister replied: “My sleep cycle has gone for a toss”. He isn’t alone. Vikram Ahuja, chairman, Euro International School, Jodhpur, reiterates what the minister said. “My sleep cycle is something of a joke now.

Till a month back, I used to sleep eight to nine hours, including an hour or two in the afternoon. Now, I don’t sleep in the afternoon and yet, I can’t sleep before 3 am or 4 am and I wake up by 9 am,” Ahuja says. The edupreneur is worried as parents haven’t paid school fee for this quarter and the scenario looks bleak. “I am anxious about how to meet expenses of my 400-odd staff,” he says. Ahuja has stopped checking his sleep quality on his GOQii fitness band “as I’m always awake now. I no longer get into the deep sleep state.”

So when did sleep become a luxury? Just when did an industry prop up selling gadgets, apps, smart mattresses, sleeping pods, special linen, pillows and more, to help you rest better? Simply put, there’s a spurt of awareness followed with disposable incomes. Now we have annual sleep events that go beyond medical know-hows. In September, this year, the Indian Society for Sleep Research (ISSR) is organising the India Sleep Show 2020. “Our aim is not just to address the current issues and priorities in terms of scientific research and practice but also to lay bare the attractive market opportunities in the growing sleep-health economy,” says Dr HN Mallick, president, ISSR, and with Department of Physiology, AIIMS.

So what exactly is the sleep-health economy? Everybody wants a good night’s sleep. Earlier it meant having a cup of warm milk or a hot shower before hitting the bed. But not anymore. Today, the sleep industry comprises sleep-tech, which includes wearable devices and apps that tell you how much and how well you slept and the contactless tech used in mattresses, pillows, linen and so on.

And as the Covid-19 pandemic continues to ravage our lives, the sleep industry is looking to reach out far and wide. Sleep Cycle, an app that tracks quality of sleep, started offering its content free when the lockdown in the country was announced so as to help people sleep better in anxious times. Similarly, last month, Headspace app started a free module called ‘Weathering the storm’, which includes meditation and movement exercises for better sleep.

The sleep economy is growing and coming to its aid is the wakefulness of Indians. According to Philips’ global sleep survey report ‘Wake Up Call: Global Sleep Satisfaction Trends’, released last month, there is a need for ‘sleep-health’ among Indian adults. The survey points out that 55 percent of Indian adults “snooze” their alarm one to two times, while 17 percent “snooze” at least five times.

Snooze Entrepreneurs

It was their own lack of sleep as new parents that led Harshil Salot and Priyanka Salot to start The Sleep Company in 2017. While they searched for a mattress to solve their sleeping troubles, they realised that the Indian market lags way behind its Western counterpart. So they set up the company, which solely did research and development (R&D) for the next 2.5 years.

They shunned age-old technologies. “We set out on a mission to change the quality of sleep and thus was born the Smart Grid which is a patent-pending technology made from a hyper-elastic polymer invented by Dr V Tripathi, former polymer head of DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation),” says co-founder Priyanka Salot.

The company maintains that the Smart Grid mattress adapts to every human body type, adjusting its firmness as per the body shape or sleeping style, thereby keeping the spine intact. “It was launched in July 2019 and is made from German and Japanese technologies,” says Salot.

Their mattresses range between Rs 16,900 and Rs 57,900 and the company has seen 500 percent growth since its launch.A bunch of startups are cashing in on the new-found interest of Indians in their mattresses, which is slated to hitRs 14,000 crore (as per CRISIL), by 2021.

“The industry has been growing at a CAGR of 7-9 percent. A combination of demonetisation, GST and urbanisation is rapidly enabling the category to transition from an unorganised sector to an organised one,” says Rahul Gautam, managing director, Sheela Foam Ltd that has various categories of mattresses under their Sleepwell brand, offering options like ‘takes shape of your body’ to using natural ingredients that prevent dust mites, and the price points go up to Rs 40,000.

It’s no surprise that the digitally connected Indian is no longer satisfied with the ‘gaddewala’ from the local market. He is looking for options that provide an enhanced sleep experience. Last year, Bengaluru-based sleep solutions provider Wakefit offered sleep internship where it paid 23 interns Rs 1 lakh each to sleep nine hours a night for 100 nights.

It was part of their R&D for their mattresses range. Some are going back to nature. Jeeva, a mattress brand by Pune-based sleep solutions provider Wink & Nod, claims to use age-old Ayurvedic principles in helping you sleep better at night.

If mattresses are inching ahead then could pillows or bedsheets be far behind? Bengaluru-based startup CuddlPillow claims to sell “India’s first adjustable thickness shredded foam pillows” and its range includes orthopaedic memory foam pillows and kids’ pillows. Then there is SPACES from Wellspun India, which is promoting HygroCotton, a patented spinning technology that uses a hollow core cotton yarn.

The company claims that the fabric made from HygroCotton bed linen has been designed to give a comfortable sleep by regulating temperature and adjusting itself +/- 2 degree, keeping it cool in the summers and warm in the winters. “Till a few years ago, the criteria to pick a bedsheet were design and price. But now, people want to know about the incremental benefit. They are seeking out sheets that help them sleep better, that are anti-microbial, or created using sustainable practices,” says pokesperson of SPACES.

And selling sleep to you while in transit are the sleeping pods in airports. Dubai-based Aviserv Airport Services established GoSleep pods at Terminal 2 of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, Mumbai, in 2018. More such sleeping pods have now come up in airports in Delhi and Bengaluru. Charged at an hourly rate, sleeping pods offer customers better options than just reclining on uncomfortable chairs in the lounge struggling to sleep while using the free airport wifi.

Tech to Sleep

If Arora is gung-ho about his smart mattress then Sandeep Mall swears by his Sleep Cycle app. Mall, a 54-year-old Faridabad resident, started using the app two years ago when he set about following a healthy lifestyle—one that checked all verticals viz. sleep, nutrition and fitness. He now consciously tries to fit in the desired hours of sleep.

Mall believes that on the days he sleeps seven hours or more, it turns out to be a productive day compared to when he sleeps fewer hours. “I have always believed that you need to have data to improve things. And now that I have my sleep patterns, I have complete control over my lifestyle,” he says.

Swedish firm Sleep Cycle was launched in 2009 and its alarm clock is one of the most downloaded intelligent alarm clocks and sleep trackers, helping people improve their sleep. “Getting to know your own sleep pattern is both fascinating and scarily addictive. After all, no one knows what’s going on while we sleep. That is for Sleep Cycle to find out,” says CEO Carl Johan Hederoth.

Sleep Cycle uses a patented sound technology algorithm designed to monitor movements in bed and translate these into sleep phases and graphs. In the morning, Sleep Cycle uses the analysis to wake its users in light sleep phase, a natural way to wake up feeling rested.

The app, which has over a million downloads, generates nightly sleep reports, tracks long-term sleep trends, and logs how daily activities impact sleep quality. “It does this by using manually input data and automatically generated data from Apple health, among other sources, and correlating it to sleep quality generated by the app measuring the users movements and consistency sleep stages,” adds Hederoth.

Even as tech invades our lives, the medical fraternity isn’t sure how scientifically helpful are these gadgets or algorithms. There are several studies that report how sleep-tracking technology, which primarily looks at body movement and heart rate, may be providing inaccurate data. It could even worsen insomnia by making people obsessed about achieving perfect sleep, a condition termed as orthosomnia. But then again not many consider it important to seek medical help for such disorders. According to Dr JC Suri, chairman of Indian Sleep Disorder Association, he is yet to meet patients who complain that their apps show they have slept less.

""But it could also be because the awareness about the need for treatment for issues like insomnia, sleep apnea and snoring is still very less. People come for sleep disorders only when the condition worsens,"" he adds. A point reiterated by Dr Srikanta of Aster CMI Hospital. ""Awareness related to sleep disorders is quite poor. A recent survey conducted by Philips in many countries, including India, suggested that almost half the Indians believe snoring to be normal or caused by factors such as genetics or old age, reemphasising the need to spread awareness not only to public but also among health care providers,"" he says.

But tech is what has helped Gurgaon resident Honey Singh put his sleep cycle in order. Singh, CEO, public relations & content marketing, #ARM World, uses Sleep Cycle and Pillow app to monitor his sleep quality and lead a stress-free life. A little over a year back, Singh was working late into the night with irregular sleep and finally it took a toll on his body.

Stress had started affecting his personal and professional life. ""I realised I need to take stock of my life. I started tracking my sleep data and consciously made an effort to hit the bed by 10 pm. Nothing works in silo, so if you do not use the data to improve your lifestyle then it is of no use,"" says Singh.

Slumber Solutions

Sleep, which has for long been under-rated, is coming into its own now when people started focusing on wellness, which meant going beyond healthy eating and exercise. For sure, sleep doesn’t rank high in the scheme of healthy living, what with world leaders like Donald Trump and Narendra Modi publicly extolling how they require no more than four to five hours of sleep.

But things are changing, says Dr Suri, who set up the country’s first sleep lab way back in 1990 at the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi. He recalls how it was still not an important part of medicine: ""At that time, when there were hardly any sleep labs, I used to barely get three patients a month. Now when we have over 100 such sleep centres, I see at least 10 patients a day with sleep issues.""

And as awareness rose, so did the demand for products that catered to the modern requirements. So much so that online portals are opening offline retail stores dedicated exclusively to sleep. Last year, Pepperfry Snooze Studios was launched in Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. A

first-of-its-kind studio, the interactive set-up has visually interesting window displays with in-store experts who guide customers with relevant sleep trivia and product info based on their preferences and budget. ""We try and understand customer requirements and details like room sizes, ergonomic and back-related issues, existing home interior design and thereafter suggest the best options for them,"" says Ashish Shah, co-founder & COO, Pepperfry.

For the modern man struggling with stress and anxiety, sleep is a luxury. According to the recent GOQii India Fit Report, about 9.8 percent of the users are trying to improve their sleep quality, which includes getting sound sleep at night. The GOQii Tracker uses actigraphy, a non-invasive method of monitoring human rest and activity cycles, to track and examine your sleep quality.

""A user can also log their sleep patterns on the app and consult a coach on what needs to be done to improve the quality and quantity of sleep,"" says Vishal Gondal, founder and CEO, GOQii, a tech-enabled healthcare platform with five million users. So as a tech entrepreneur, who also sells sleep, does he need any external aid to fall asleep? Undoubtedly, yes.

""I wear a Muse band for meditation that calms me. It captures my data and shows me that my mind is actually in the state of calm,"" says Gondal. GOQii has certified coaches who give out tips on sleeping right and improving the sleep quality on their interactive live video platform GOQii Play on the GOQii App.

Larger conglomerates too have tapped the potential. Philips is now a global leader in Sleep Diagnostic and Therapy solutions with years of research leading to patient-driven products. The Philips Respironics sleep apnea therapy devices help patients with sleep apnea in the long term.

The company also offers a broad range of care solutions for people living with obstructive sleep apnea, including the award-winning Dream Family comprising DreamWear, a comprehensive portfolio of advanced mask designs; DreamStation, a CPAP (continuous positive airways pressure) therapy system connecting patients and care teams; and DreamMapper, an application that helps patients adjust to sleep therapy and compliance.

And just as the industry is growing, so are the number of sleep specialists. Take, for instance, the popularity of the National Sleep Technology Course run annually by ISSR since 2014. ""The aim of the course is to build a cadre of Polysomnographic Technologists who would become global leaders in sleep technology and provide high quality sleep technology services,"" says Dr Mallick.

ISSR also conducts regular national and international conference on sleep, sleep medicine course, certification examination for sleep technicians, sleep specialist and accreditation of sleep laboratories. ""Our sleep workshops are in high demand. The seats are limited to 25 participants only because of its intensive nature (theory, practical, skill development, interpretation and analysis),"" adds Dr Mallick.

GROWTH Forecasts

The rise in income levels coupled with awareness towards stress management has resulted in building up a robust sleep economy. According to management consulting firm Redseer, the mattress and sleep category is estimated to be a $2.5 billion market in India by 2022, growing at a CAGR of 8 to 10 percent.

A considerable number of companies are operating only through the online space where people are looking for luxury mattresses that offer comfort and customised solutions. And those that are online like Flo Mattress are now planning to enter the offline business with experiential stores. The industry has witnessed a massive shift in terms of consumer mindset.

""In India alone, about 34 percent of consumers are inclined towards educating themselves regarding the importance of sleep. The brand Pepperfry drives most customers to walk into our Snooze Studios at first. However, the response to the concept of a Sleep Studio has been impressive with a conversion rate of close to 60 to 70 percent,"" says Shah of Pepperfry.

As per a report by Research and Markets, the healthcare apps market in India was valued at Rs 27.01 billion in 2018. It is estimated to reach Rs 138 billion by 2024, expanding at a CAGR of 31.61 percent.

And while promoters of sleep do the number crunching, Pawan Arora is working out another arithmatic. His “investment on health” has started paying returns. He no longer needs an orthopaedic belt. While Vikram Ahuja worries over Covid-19, Arora is losing no sleep over the crisis as his mattress ensures that sleep is just a few seconds away once he hits the sleep mode."

Podcasts are saving the day—and the night—for helpless couch potatoes. A new conversation has begun around fresh perspectives. Comedians, filmmakers, motivational speakers, authors, and well-known Youtubers have taken to discussing matters on different audio platforms with hosts. Pick the ones you like and listen to fresh conversations.

Comedian Aditi Mittal, who co-hosts a popular podcast, Women in Labour, gets quite chatty about the importance of women in the workforce. It’s a different spin on the usual feminist or ultra power girls.

In her podcast, she deals with women being perceived as economic agents. People share stories they wouldn’t talk about in their dreams. “Lots of women who’ve been working all their lives, are surprised that someone is talking about such issues and acknowledging their contribution,” she says.

The co-creator of the same podcast, Christina MacGillivray is sanguine about bringing together journalists, filmmakers, social scientists, economists, entrepreneurs, and opinion-makers on her vocal stage. “Covid-19 has created a situation that is both a challenge and perhaps, an opportunity for discussing women and work.

In a public health crisis as is happening now, women are often expected to do do work extra as unpaid caregivers. At the same time, we have a unique situation where both men and women are home together. This is an opportunity for men to help out with cooking, care-giving and cleaning, all gratis. To develop the sense of community and solidarity, we keep the tone uplifting and conversations energetic,” she says.

Given that an overdose of virus data and news has consumed us, motivational speaker and host, Gaia Morrissette entertains listeners with subjects revolving around sexual wellness on her podcast, Tickle.Life. Gaia says, “With the podcast, we are saying, accept yourself and acknowledge that each one of us are unique and have our own needs and desires. In the current scenario, a lot of people are going through an existential crisis and we are here to tell them, it is okay. We talk about fun things related to sexuality and get experts to share information on wellness. We’re giving you something new and different.”

Podcasts are making desires of Bollywood fans to tune into their favourite stars speaking about life issues. The host of Film City on JioSaavn, Rahul Krishan Ahuja, presents weekly reviews, recommendations and short interviews on the app for Bollywood fans.

Say Ahuja, ""We have featured short conversations with Vicky Kaushal, Taapsee Pannu, Rasika Duggal, Dar Gai, Dheer Momaya, Arshad Warsi, Ridhi Dogra and Vijay Verma in our weekly episodes. We have discovered that during the lockdown, people are turning to art. They also look for recommendations on what we discuss in our shows.""

People working from home who’re missing the usual chitchat at work, and endless banter with friends, now find listening to podcasts therapeutic. It gives them good company. The host of The Master’s Voice, Pavan R Chawla, is convinced that podcasts are the next big thing in India.

""I’ve seen that people working from home are working even harder. They want to get all the business updates. But they’re also fighting to stay afloat. We invite top CEOs to speak on such concerns and motivate listeners through podcasts."" Where there’s the internet, there’s a way."

Express News Service

NEW DELHI: The Government of India has swiftly moved to block deep-pocketed Chinese entities from mounting opportunistic takeovers of vulnerable, pandemic-hit Indian firms. On Friday, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry moved a notification amending its Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy, making government approval mandatory for any investment from countries sharing a ""land border"" with India.

The notification comes soon after several sections of the industry warned the Centre that heavily capitalised Chinese entities and funds were shopping for vulnerable Indian companies laid low by the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Centre's amendment seems clearly aimed at preventing such takeovers by Chinese entities, since out of the seven countries India shares a land border with, investments from Pakistan and Bangladesh already required government approval. Excluding China, the rest -- Afghanistan, Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar -- are insignificant sources of FDI into India and aren't generally perceived as financial national security threats.

The earlier policy had allowed FDI through the automatic route in over 1,000 categories, except for 16 sectors including defence and telecom.

The newly amended policy now says that ""an entity of a country which shares a land border with India, or where the beneficial owner of an investment into India is situated in… can invest only under the government route"".

This condition shall also apply to the transfer of ownership of FDI, which ""directly or indirectly"" results in beneficial ownership falling to entities in one of these countries, said the notification.

The move comes after a series of developments and warnings from industry bodies to the Centre. For instance, March shareholding disclosures had revealed that the Chinese central bank now held a 1.01 per cent stake in one of India's biggest blue-chip financial firms: HDFC.

Other countries like Australia and Germany have also recently tightened FDI rules to prevent Chinese companies from indulging in predatory behaviour and buying out firms left vulnerable by the Covid-19 pandemic."

NEW DELHI: On the occasion of World Heritage Day, the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) illuminated five prominent heritage buildings in the national capital — Red Fort, Qutb Minar, Humayun’s Tomb, Purana Qila and Safdarjung’s Tomb after sunset on Saturday.

Special ceremonies were held at Mughal fort-palace Red Fort, Humayun’s Tomb and Qutub Minar in Mehrauli, where 41 earthen lamps and candles were lit. An official of the survey said that to express solidarity with all ‘coronavirus warriors’ such as doctors, police officers, and civil administration, who are performing their duties despite all odds, the programme to light candles and earthen lamps was organised.

“At Humayun’s Tomb, we lit 41 candles, which symbolise a 41-day lockdown period. It signifies that one candle of humanity is enough to fight darkness. This way, we expressed our determination that we would stand united with these warriors,” the official said. The official further said that on the occasion, the agency had decided to keep architectural lights on at these sites for two hours daily, a practise, which was stopped during the lockdown.

“ASI stopped illuminating these heritage sites because of lockdown to cut on power bills. All monuments and historical buildings are closed due to the virus outbreak hence it was decided not to switch on lights. However, we will illuminate these buildings for two hours daily from here on,” he added.



Several students and teachers of ASPAM Scottish Noida and CSHP Public School were also administered a pledge to protect the heritage structures via a video conference."

NEW DELHI: All the Tier-1 cities, including Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Pune, Hyderabad and Bengaluru, have nearly 40 per cent of COVID-19 positive cases.

Analysis of the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases and the cities where they were detected has shown that all these Tier-1 cities excluding Kolkata and Bengaluru have a high concentration of positive cases.

While the total number of COVID- 19 cases on Saturday stood at 14,676, these Tier-1 cities have a total number of 5,803 cases which is nearly 40 per cent of the total cases.

Mumbai stood at the top with 2,003 positive cases while Delhi was in the second position with over 1,700 confirmed cases.

Other four Tier-1 cities with a considerable number of positive cases are Ahmedabad (765), Pune (430), Hyderabad (417) and Chennai (233). Bengaluru and Kolkata have comparatively fewer cases 97 and 151 respectively.

Apart from this, there are five more cities including Indore, Bhopal, Agra, Jaipur and Surat with nearly 1,860 positive cases. Indore in Madhya Pradesh has seen an unusually high number, nearly 850 cases, and these cases have mostly been found in lower middle- income group families.

Jaipur in Rajasthan, known as a major tourist destination, has also emerged as a city with an unusually large number of cases. Further analysis of the data showed that altogether these 13 cities have over 52 per cent of the total positive cases. While the government has identified over 170 hotspot districts in the country, these 13 cities have the highest COVID-19 positive cases.

For all the hotspots, the state governments have been tasked with ensuring that that the disease is contained.

If no new outbreaks are reported within 28 days and all the existing patients recover, the area can be declared a green zone.

For a concerted push in red zones, the government said there should be special teams to conduct door-to-door surveys and tests.

The tests will not just be for COVID-19. Patients of influenza-related illness and SARI (Severe Acute Respiratory Illness) will also be tested since such patients have often tested positive for COVID-19."
