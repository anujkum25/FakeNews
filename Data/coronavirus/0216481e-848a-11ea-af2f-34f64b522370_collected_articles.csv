A Delhi Police constable who tested positive for COVID-19 Saturday shared a video on social media complaining of lack of hygiene and healthcare in the hospital where he is being treated.

The constable was posted at Tilak Vihar police post, which comes under West Delhi‚Äôs Tilak Nagar. A senior police officer said a group of policemen were tested Friday at a DDY dispensary in Tilak Vihar. A day later, the constable tested positive. He was shifted to Chaudhary Brahm Prakash Ayurved Charak Sansthan, a designated COVID hospital in Dwarka.

On Tuesday, the constable shared a video online. He said, ‚ÄúThis place is unhygienic. Over 20 patients, who are being treated on the same floor, share a common bathroom. If anyone complains of fever or throat pain, the hospital staff doesn‚Äôt give them medicines.‚Äù The constable also alleged that patients are not provided with hot water, sanitisers, handwash and proper bedding. ‚ÄúThis pillow has black stains all over it. The staff doesn‚Äôt change the sheets and pillows.‚Äù

The man added his family has not been tested yet. ‚ÄúI request the authorities to take me to a private hospital. I have a Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) card.‚Äù

DCP (West) Deepak Purohit said, ‚ÄúWe will take care of the well-being of our staff and their family. We are following guidelines issued by Indian Council of Medical Research. We have sent hand sanitisers and kettles to the constable.‚Äù Senior police officers in Dwarka said they visited the hospital and met the staff. An officer said, ‚ÄúWe spoke to their administration to check the cleanliness of the pillow and toilet.‚Äù

Police sources also said later on Tuesday, DCP (Dwarka) met the hospital director and all concerns of the policeman have been addressed. The hospital was unreachable for a comment.

With Chinese testing kits having come under the scanner, India is stepping up procurement and production of testing kits from South Korean companies.

Officials on Tuesday said that a South Korean company has agreed to make and supply 5 lakh rapid antibody testing kits at its facility in Manesar, Haryana.

India‚Äôs ambassador to South Korea Sripriya Ranganathan visited the firm‚Äôs ‚Äî SD Biosensor ‚Äî facility in north Chungcheong province in South Korea and has tied up the arrangements.

The company has decided to manufacture these kits in a week, and will make more in the next few weeks.

This comes as the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday advised states not to use the testing kits for the next two days, stating that it will issue an advisory after medical teams carry out field validation of the kits.

Coronavirus (COVID-19): Maharashtra added another 552 novel Coronavirus patients on Tuesday, taking the country within touching distance of 20,000 cases. The day also saw at least 52 deaths being reported from across the states, the highest the country has seen in a single day since the start of the outbreak.

By Tuesday night, the total number of positive cases in the country had reached 19,975. Maharashtra, with 5218 cases, accounted for more than a quarter of that number.

Tuesday happened to be the third straight day when Maharashtra contributed more than one-third of all the new Coronavirus cases reported in the country. On Sunday too, the state had added 552 cases, while on Monday 466 new cases had emerged in the state.

A total of 1510 new infections were reported from across the country on Tuesday, the second-highest single day increase since the virus began to spread in India in the first week of March. The biggest increase had come on Sunday, when 1577 new cases had emerged. Other major contributors to Tuesday‚Äôs increase were Gujarat, which reported 239 fresh cases, Rajasthan, which had 159, and Uttar Pradesh, which had 153 new cases.

In the process, Gujarat overtook Delhi as the state with the second highest number of cases in the country. Gujarat now has 2178 cases while Delhi, which added 75 new cases on Tuesday, has 2156.

Even Kerala reported a significant number of cases on Tuesday. Its 19 cases were the highest the state has reported in the last 20 days. Kerala now has 426 people who have tested positive for the infection.

Despite the large number of cases being added in the last few days, the spread of the disease in India has slowed down considerably as a result of the lockdown. India took eight days to travel from 10,000 cases to 20,000 cases. Before the impact of lockdown had become evident, the country was witnessing an exponential growth in the number of cases. It had taken around two weeks to move from three cases at the start of March to 100 cases, another two weeks to reach 1000 cases, and a little more than two weeks to touch the 10,000 figure. At that rate, the country would have on its way to reach one lakh cases by the end of the month. But thanks to the lockdown, and other measures taken by the government, all indications are that the total number of cases at the end of this month would be somewhere between 25,000 and 30,000.

A large proportion of the fresh cases are being reported from only a handful of states. Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh together accounted for 75 per cent of all new cases on Tuesday. If the contributions of another four states ‚Äì Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana ‚Äì were included, it would account for more than 90 per cent of all new cases.

These were also the states where maximum number of deaths had happened. There were nineteen deaths in Maharashtra, some of which had happened earlier but could be confirmed only on Tuesday. Gujarat reported at least 13 deaths while Madhya Pradesh had eight, and Uttar Pradesh four.

https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/donald-trump-us-immigration-coronavirus-6374059/,"President Donald Trump speaks about the coronavirus in the James Brady Press Briefing Room of the White House, Tuesday, April 21, 2020, in Washington.

President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he will issue an executive order to temporarily suspend immigration to the United States to protect US workers amid the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak.

‚ÄúIt would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labor flown in from abroad,‚Äù Trump said during a White House press briefing. ‚ÄúWe must first take care of the American worker.‚Äù

Still, some questions remained unanswered on Tuesday as the Trump administration continued to work on the order, which follows a series of previous steps the president has taken to clamp down on legal immigration.

Trump immigration order: Who will be affected?

Trump said the executive order would only apply to immigrants seeking permanent residency in the United States, a process informally known as obtaining a green card. The order will not affect people entering on temporary non-immigrant visas, he said. Such visas are used by tourists, business travelers and foreign workers.

The US Department of State issued roughly 462,000 immigrant visas in fiscal year 2019, which began on Oct. 1, 2018. How many immigrant visa applicants might be affected by Trump‚Äôs planned executive order remains unclear.

In light of the attack from the Invisible Enemy, as well as the need to protect the jobs of our GREAT American Citizens, I will be signing an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 21, 2020

Trump said the order, which could be signed as soon as Wednesday, will have exemptions, but did not provide details. Trump did not say what the executive order would mean for people who have immigrant visas and jobs secured in the United States but have not yet moved to the United States.

How long will the suspension last?

The suspension will last 60 days, according to Trump. After that, the president said he will review US economic conditions and decide whether it should be extended. Future extensions could potentially be longer than 60 days, Trump said.

What will happen to temporary foreign workers?

A senior administration official told Reuters the White House was considering a separate action that could deal with skilled workers who enter the country on H-1B visas and others affected by US immigration policy.

The potential executive order would include exemptions for people involved in responding to the coronavirus outbreak, including farm workers and those helping to secure US food supplies, the official said.

Trump said at the briefing Tuesday that he may issue a second order at a later date, but did not provide details.

Does Trump have the power to suspend immigration?

The Supreme Court ruled in 2018 that Trump could block the entry of certain foreigners from countries deemed a security threat, an affirmation of the president‚Äôs power to restrict legal immigration under federal law. Some legal experts argue the court‚Äôs ruling does not permit a broad, worldwide ban on immigration into the United States and expect any order to be challenged in court.

Andrea Flores, a deputy policy director with the American Civil Liberties Union, which has sued over a number of Trump immigration policies, said Trump appeared ‚Äúmore interested in fanning anti-immigrant flames than in saving lives‚Äù with his latest proposal.

How has Trump restricted immigration before?

The Trump administration has used several legal avenues to restrict travel to the United States in the past. Trump issued an executive order in late January that barred entry to certain travelers from China, where the coronavirus first surfaced. He similarly blocked certain travelers from Iran in February and Europe in March.

Well before the pandemic, Trump had issued travel bans for national security reasons. In late January, he added Nigeria and five other countries to a list of countries subject to visa restrictions.

What does immigration look like now?

The United States suspended routine visa services in most countries worldwide on March 18 due to the coronavirus outbreak, which was expected to dramatically slow legal immigration.In addition, countries around the world have closed their borders and enacted quarantines to limit the spread of the virus, greatly reducing travel worldwide.

The State Department issues monthly visa reports that illustrate the latest trends, but that data for March is not yet public.

Would blocking immigrants help the economy?

A record 22 million Americans sought unemployment benefits over the past month, nearly wiping out all the job gains since the Great Recession.

Trump said on Tuesday that an immigration suspension would protect US workers, an extension of the message he employed during his 2016 presidential campaign. The plan drew both praise and criticism.

Thomas Homan, Trump‚Äôs former acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said it ‚Äúmakes sense‚Äù and will keep the country safer while preserving jobs for unemployed Americans.

Giovanni Peri, an economics professor at the University of California, Davis, said researchers generally agree that immigration into the United States has stimulated economic growth, increased the size of the economy and created jobs. ‚ÄúThe idea that immigration threatens American jobs is just not there in any data,‚Äù he said.

(Source: Getty Images/Thickstock) Flushing creates ‚Äútoilet plumes‚Äù, which are a subject of ongoing research. (Source: Getty Images/Thickstock)

If someone going outdoors during the lockdown needs to use a public toilet, or if someone shares a toilet at home with someone who might have contracted COVID-19, is there a risk of being infected through the faeces of the infected person? The short answer: it is possible in theory, but very unlikely to happen.

Emerging information on the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2, which causes COVID-19 disease, suggests that the virus can be present in some cases. But as the Health Ministry notes in its FAQs, spread of the novel coronavirus through the faecal route is not the main feature of the outbreak. The primary route remains droplets from an infected person coughing or sneezing. Spread through this route is far more common than spread through touching infected objects and then touching one‚Äôs face, mouth or nose.

The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that the virus has been detected in the faeces of some COVID-19 patients, but what is unknown is the amount of virus in the stool, or whether the virus in stool is infectious at all. As such, the risk of transmission is also unknown. ‚ÄúHowever, the risk is expected to be low based on data from previous outbreaks of related coronaviruses (SARS and MERS)‚Ä¶ There has been no confirmed fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 to date.‚Äù

Read | How a Covid-19 carrier at a China restaurant infected only 9 other diners

It may seem that flushing a toilet will have got rid of the virus, even if it was present in the faeces. But flushing creates ‚Äútoilet plumes‚Äù, which are a subject of ongoing research. Toilet plumes refer to the dispersal of microscopic particles as a result of flushing. Over the last several years, researchers have been studying the risk of toilet plume aerosols sent into the air, then settling on the toilet seat and infecting someone. In a study published in the American Journal of Infection Control in 2013, which itself was based on an analysis of several peer-reviewed studies, researchers found that potentially infectious aerosols may be produced in substantial quantities during flushing, which can expose subsequent toilet users. Yet, they added, no studies have yet clearly demonstrated or refuted toilet plume-related disease transmission. The paper stressed the need for additional research.

It is considered good hygiene if you flush the toilet with the lid down. A widespread view is that doing so prevents some of the toilet plume from escaping into the air. It also makes sense to wait a few minutes before using a toilet that has just been used by someone else.

While noting that the risk of catching COVID-19 from faeces appears to be low, the Health Ministry adds: ‚ÄúBecause this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly, after using the bathroom and before eating.‚Äù

Coronavirus (Covid-19): Stating that attacks on healthcare workers ‚Äúwill not be tolerated‚Äù, Union Minister Prakash Javadekar Wednesday announced that the central government has brought in an ordinance wherein guilty will be handed up to seven years of imprisonment.

‚ÄúHealth workers who are trying to save the country from this epidemic are unfortunately facing attacks. No incident of violence or harassment against them will be tolerated. An ordinance has been brought in, it will be implemented after the President‚Äôs sanction,‚Äù Javadekar said while addressing a media briefing.

The Cabinet approved promulgation of an Ordinance to amend the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, making such acts of violence as cognizable and non-bailable offences and to provide compensation for injury to healthcare service personnel or for causing damage or loss to the property.

The Cabinet decision comes hours after Union Home Minister Amit Shah and Health Minister Harsh Vardhan interacted with doctors and senior representatives of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), through a video conference, in New Delhi.

Allaying all concerns of the medical fraternity regarding their security in the fight against the novel coronavirus, the Home Minister has assured them that the government would leave no stone unturned in ensuring their wellbeing and security. Following the meeting with Shah, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) decided to withdraw their symbolic protest.

Coronavirus (Covid-19) India Tracker LIVE Updates: Union minister Prakash Javadekar Wednesday said the Centre will not tolerate the attacks on the healthcare workers in the country amid the coronavirus pandemic and has brought an ordinance to make it a punishable offence. In a Cabinet briefing, Javadekar said the government will amend the Epidemics Diseases Act, 1897 to make the attacks on healthcare workers a cognisable and non-bailable offence, under which a violeter may be awarded with a jail term of three months to five years with a fine of Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh. In cases of severe injury to workers, the jail term will be increased to six month to seven years with a fine of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.

The number of coronavirus cases in India stood at 19,984 on Wednesday, including 15,474 active cases and 640 deaths. States across the country added over 50 deaths on Tuesday, the highest single-day toll since the start of the outbreak. Maharashtra reported the highest infections (5,218), followed by Gujarat (2,178) and Delhi (2,156).

Centre brings law on attacks on healthcare workers

Union minister Prakash Javadekar Union minister Prakash Javadekar

Union minister Prakash Javadekar Wednesday said the Centre will not tolerate the attacks on the healthcare workers in the country amid the coronavirus pandemic and has decided to bring an ordinance to make it a punishable offence. Javadekar said the government will amend the Epidemics Diseases Act, 1897 to make the attacks on healthcare workers a cognisable and non-bailable offence, under which a violator may be awarded a jail term of three months to five years with a fine of Rs 50,000 to Rs 2 lakh. In cases of severe injury to workers, the jail term will be increased to six months to seven years with a fine of Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh.

Explained Can virus spread from the faeces of an infected person? The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that the virus has been detected in the faeces of some COVID-19 patients, but what is unknown is the amount of virus in the stool, or whether the virus in stool is infectious at all. As such, the risk of transmission is also unknown. ‚ÄúHowever, the risk is expected to be low based on data from previous outbreaks of related coronaviruses (SARS and MERS)‚Ä¶ There has been no confirmed fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19 to date.‚Äù

Amid the tussle between the Centre and West Bengal over lockdown violations, the Mamata Banerjee government on Tuesday assured cooperation to the two Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCT) that landed in the state on Monday to assesses its handling of the COVID-19 situation. The development comes a day after the Union Home Secretary Ajay Bhalla shot off a letter to Rajiv Sinha, the Chief Secretary, asking him to comply with the Union Home Ministry‚Äôs order on easing of restrictions in the state.

Coronavirus (COVID-19): By Tuesday night, the total number of positive cases in the country had reached 19,975. Coronavirus (COVID-19): By Tuesday night, the total number of positive cases in the country had reached 19,975.

Despite the large number of cases being added in the last few days, the spread of the disease in India has slowed down considerably as a result of the lockdown. India took eight days to travel from 10,000 cases to 20,000 cases. Before the impact of lockdown had become evident, the country was witnessing an exponential growth in the number of cases. It had taken around two weeks to move from three cases at the start of March to 100 cases, another two weeks to reach 1000 cases, and a little more than two weeks to touch the 10,000 figure. At that rate, the country would have on its way to reach one lakh cases by the end of the month. But thanks to the lockdown, and other measures taken by the government, all indications are that the total number of cases at the end of this month would be somewhere between 25,000 and 30,000.

Coronavirus Latest Updates: On Tuesday alone, the Covid-19 toll in US increased by more than 2,750 deaths to take overall casualties over 45,000 deaths ‚Äî by far the highest in the world. At least 2,553,853 have been infected worldwide and over 1,76,000 people have died since the outbreak began. The US also tops in the highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases with over 8,10,000 cases, almost four times as many as Spain(200,210), the country with the second-highest number. It is followed by Italy (181,228), France (156,480) and Germany (147,065).

The World health Organisation, late on Tuesday confirmed that all available evidence suggests the novel coronavirus originated in animals in China late last year and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory.

Key developments in the global coronavirus outbreak today include:

Tensions arise as EU leaders mull huge virus recovery plan

European Union leaders are preparing for a new virtual summit to take stock of the damage the coronavirus has inflicted on the lives and livelihoods of the bloc‚Äôs citizens and to thrash out a more robust plan to revive their ravaged economies. As some Europeans take their first tentative steps out of confinement to return to work or school, and as businesses on the continent cautiously open their doors, the leaders will endorse urgent spending measures and debate a massive recovery plan they hope to introduce in coming weeks.

Around 1 million people in Europe and Britain have now tested positive for the coronavirus and more than 100,000 of them have died over half of the world‚Äôs death toll according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.

UN agency: 1st virus case recorded in Lebanon refugee camp

A Palestinian woman from Syria has become the first refugee living in a camp in Lebanon to test positive for the coronavirus, the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Wednesday.

The agency, UNRWA, said the woman lives in one of the camps in eastern Lebanon‚Äôs Bekaa region. It said all necessary measures have been taken and the patient was transferred to the government-run Rafik Hariri Hospital in Beirut, adding that the agency will cover the entire cost of her treatment.

Lebanon is home to more than 1 million Syrian refugees and other Syrians who are residents. It is also host to tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, most of them living in squalid camps with no access to public services, with limited employment opportunities and no rights to ownership.

China on Wednesday again reported no new deaths from the coronavirus, but registered 30 more cases ‚Äì23 of them brought from abroad. Of the domestic cases, all seven were reported in Heilongjiang province near the Russian border where a field hospital has been set up to deal with a new flare-up related to people coming home from abroad. Just over 1,000 people are hospitalized for treatment, while about the same number are under isolation and monitoring as either suspected cases or after testing positive but showing no symptoms. China has reported a total of 4,632 deaths among 82,788 cases, the bulk of them in Wuhan where officials recently raised the death toll by 50% after a review of records.

Meanwhile, the state of Missouri filed a lawsuit against the Chinese government over the coronavirus, alleging that nation‚Äôs officials are to blame for the global pandemic.

Italy records first significant fall in infections Italy reported 534 new deaths on Tuesday, 80 more than on Monday, bringing the death toll to 24,648. But the number of people currently infected with the virus fell by 528 to 107,709, the first significant fall since the outbreak began. Italy‚Äôs total cases to date, including victims and survivors, rose by 2,727 to 183,957.

Virus cancels world events

The worldwide cancellation of major events that weren‚Äôt scheduled to be held for months is signaling just how gradual a process reopening economies could be amid the coronavirus pandemic. Spain called off the Running of the Bulls in July, the U.S. scrapped the national spelling bee in June and Germany canceled Oktoberfest five months away, making it clear Tuesday that the effort to beat back the coronavirus and return to normal could be a long and dispiriting process. Amid growing impatience over the shutdowns that have thrown tens of millions out of work, European countries continued to reopen in stages, while in the U.S., one state after another _ mostly ones led by Republican governors _ began taking steps to get back to business.

With deaths and infections still rising around the world, the push to reopen has set off warnings from health authorities.

Over 154 crore students are severely impacted by the closure of educational institutions across the world amid the COVID-19 outbreak due to which girls will be the worst hit as it will lead to increased drop-out rates and further entrench gender gaps in education, UNESCO said.

Stefania Giannini, UNESCO‚Äôs assistant director-general for Education, told PTI in an interview that shutting down of schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic comes with a warning of ‚Äúpotential for increased drop-out rates which will disproportionately affect adolescent girls, further entrench gender gaps in education and lead to increased risk of sexual exploitation, early pregnancy and early and forced marriage‚Äù.

‚ÄúOut of the total population of students enrolled in education globally, we estimate that over 89 per cent are currently out of school because of COVID-19. This represents 154 crore students enrolled in school or university, including nearly 74 crore girls. Over 11 crore of these girls are living in the world‚Äôs least developed countries where getting an education is already a struggle,‚Äù she told over phone from Paris.

According to Giannini, for girls living in refugee camps or who are internally displaced, shutting down of schools will be the most devastating as they are already at a disadvantage and education responses must prioritise the needs of adolescent girls‚Äô at the risk of reversing 20 years of gains made for girls‚Äô education.

‚ÄúRefugee girls at secondary level are only half as likely to enrol as their male peers. We are only beginning to understand the economic impacts of COVID-19, but they are expected to be widespread and devastating. Particularly for women and girls in countries where limited social protection measures are in place, economic hardships caused by the crisis will have spill-over effects as families consider the financial and opportunity costs of educating their daughters. While many girls will continue with their education once the school gates reopen, others will never return to school,‚Äù she said.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has called for policy-makers and practitioners to look into lessons from the past crises to address the challenges faced by girls as the governments of various counties prepare for ‚Äúindefinite‚Äù school closures.

‚ÄúAs governments prepare for indefinite school closures, policy-makers and practitioners can look to lessons from the past crises to address the specific challenges faced by girls. We, therefore, call on governments to protect progress made in favour of girls‚Äô education through six gender-responsive, evidence-based and context-specific actions,‚Äù Giannini said.

The six-point strategy suggested by UNESCO for the purpose includes leveraging teachers and communities, adopting appropriate distance learning practices, considering the digital divide, safeguarding vital services and engaging young people.

‚ÄúClosure of educational institutions even if temporary is problematic for various reasons. Firstly, the reduction in instructional time impacts learning achievement. When schools close, educational performance suffers. Disrupting schooling also leads to other harder to measure losses, including inconveniences to families and decreased economic productivity as parents struggle to balance work obligations with childcare,‚Äù she said.

Read| As learning moves online amid COVID-19, EWS students worst hit: Survey

‚ÄúThe closures also compound educational inequities as economically advantaged families tend to have higher levels of education and more resources to fill learning gaps and provide enrichment activities to children who cannot attend school,‚Äù Giannini added.

UNESCO has launched a global education coalition to support countries in scaling up their best distance learning practices and reaching children and youth who are most at risk.

More than 25 lakh people have been confirmed to have contracted the coronavirus worldwide, with 80 per cent of cases in Europe and the United States.

There have been 25,03,429 recorded cases and 1,72,551 deaths around the world. Europe, the most affected continent, has 12,30,522 official cases and 1,08,797 fatalities, while the US, where COVID-19 is spreading most rapidly, has 7,88,920 cases and 42,458 deaths.

Happy Earth Day!

Yes, we must be grateful for the rich inheritance of being born on a planet that supports such an extraordinary abundance of life forms. This pale blue dot, the biosphere, forests, oceans, rivers, lakes, deserts, mountains, flora and fauna, so rich, so diverse, all and ever giving ‚Äî connecting all life is, in fact, our only home.

This is the 50th year of the ‚ÄòEarth Day‚Äô movement started in America on the 22nd of April 1970 by environmental advocate Denis Hayes. A movement that has become one of the largest global-civic events responsible for fighting environmental ignorance.

‚ÄúDespite that amazing success and decades of environmental progress, we find ourselves facing an even more dire, almost existential, set of global environmental challenges, from loss of biodiversity to climate change to plastic pollution, that call for action at all levels of government,‚Äù said Hayes.

ALSO READ | Earth Day 2020: History, significance, theme and celebrations

Over the last 50 years millions of people that have gathered outdoors on Earth Day in protest and action to serve our planet, have now been forced to remain indoors by the Covid19 pandemic. So have the rest of the people who didn‚Äôt care to respond to the urgent warnings by environmental crusaders. Everything has shut down. Airlines, trains, industries, factories, lives have come to pause. The air is cleaner, the streets are quiet, the birds are being heard and people are discovering ways to cope with this new way of life. Now that they themselves are alone at home, many notice how simple things in life are good enough. There are millions of people who find themselves more vulnerable than ever before. Many notice how painful it must be to hold animals captive in isolation.

Few if any of us believed that within our lifetime we would collectively witness such a shared catastrophic human crisis? The scientists have spent years informing civil society and governments about the catastrophic consequences of human activity that has altered almost 75 percent of the Earth‚Äôs surface! But this, what the world is collectively experiencing, had actually been predicted by scientists, but they were ignored. Today we are collectively paying the price for this error in our ways.

Dia at Ranthambore National Park. Dia at Ranthambore National Park.

This despite the raging forest fires, the rapidly melting glaciers, extreme weather events that are causing human misery through droughts, floods, and the contamination of our water, air and food. Basically, we are destabilising life, and destroying lives and livelihoods of millions. For now, the fact is that the unempowered are paying the greatest price, but, as COVID19 demonstrated, not even royals and country heads are going to be spared. And the consequences of the disruption of human societies will be geometrically greater than the disaster we are facing at the hands of COVID19.

The fact is that we cannot go back to business as usual or we may not have any businesses, large or small, to go back to. That is the simple truth that this global lockdown has underscored for us. As Lord Nicholas Stern from the London School of Economics so often reminds us: ‚ÄúThe economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment.‚Äù

Let me explain the connection between Coronaviruses and Nature.

According to scientists, 75 percent of new and infectious diseases are zoonotic, namely ones that originate from pathogens transferred from animals to humans. The drivers of zoonotic disease emergence are largely caused by environmental change ‚Äì usually a result of human activities. To put it simply, they are human-induced. Destruction of wildlife habitat and forests, mining and industrial farming have lead to environmental changes that modify wildlife population structure and reduce biodiversity, resulting in new environmental conditions that cause the emergence of these diseases. By some estimates, these lead to over a billion cases of illnesses, resulting in millions of deaths year after year.

With 68 percent, (two-thirds) of the global population is projected to live in urban areas by 2030, imagine how much of the Earth‚Äôs surface we would have altered? We have the science, the solutions, the technology and the ability to build a world that can restore ecological balance, provided we truly aspire for a path of growth that reduces inequalities. Developing nations like our own that need to provide health, food, education and employment to her population of 1.3 billion people (second largest population on the planet) will need to swiftly develop the public and political will to ensure we do not allow any further destruction of our natural resources, wildlife habitats and forests. Ecosystem integrity underlines human health and development. Business as usual is not an option. It is a given that the protection of our biosphere is going to determine the future of all nations and their people.

An invisible virus has acted as a leveler, proving to all people that we are not above nature. It is also a stark reminder that if we continue to fail to protect biodiversity and understand the linkages of human health and progress with environment, we will perish.

Fortunately for us, there is still time. Time for us to usher in a ‚ÄòSurvival Revolution‚Äô, founded on nature-based solutions that leverage billions of years of evolution to the advantage of humans.

The theme for this Earth Day, April 22, 2020, is ‚ÄòClimate Action‚Äô. Interestingly the Paris Agreement, which has had its fair share of broken promises, non-coincidentally, was signed on Earth Day, 2016. The Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals offered us a roadmap four years ago. COVID19 came as a harsh reminder of the consequences of our ignoring the messages being sent us by the biosphere.

But let me end on a very realistic note. NATURE REPAIRS ITSELF. We have seen that demonstrated dramatically for us in the past couple of months. Billions of people have been reminded of the power of nature to give and to take away. What remains to be seen is whether or not the pandemic that envelopes us all will remain with us as a guidepost of the direction in which we choose to go. I believe we will come back to the inner belief that ALL LIFE IS CONNECTED and that we will do the right thing. Also, that ‚ÄòClimate Action‚Äô will flow not only from a lack of choice but also from the empathy and interdependency of humans with the rest of the species with which we share our beautiful, blue planet.

Let‚Äôs all learn to be greedy for good!

People‚Äôs increasing interest in cooking during the lockdown is no secret. Of all recipes, banana bread, followed by homemade pizza were the most searched on Google in the past month.

As per a Google Trends report, people have looked up more recipes than at any other time in history in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, reported Daily Mail. Among the other top 10 recipes were French toast, chicken breasts, chocolate cake, carrot cake and the lately popular Dalgona coffee. For the uninitiated, this coffee, which has been going viral on social media, originated in South Korea. It is made by whipping equal portions of instant coffee powder, sugar and hot water till it becomes creamy, and then adding cold or hot milk to it.

Dinner recipes, on the other hand, included fried rice and spaghetti bolognese laced with minced beef.

Captain Tom Moore, a 99-year-old World War II veteran, who raised million of pounds for National Health Service healthcare workers in the United Kingdom in the fight against Covid-19 has now been invited to Lord‚Äôs.

England Test captain Joe Root surprised Moore with a video call, during which he invited his fellow Yorkshireman to give the side a team talk. The World War veteran also received an invite from the MCC and the England cricket team to ring the five-minute bell at Lord‚Äôs once the current coronavirus lockdown is lifted.

‚ÄúWe cannot wait to welcome you to ring the five-minute bell at Lord‚Äôs, @captaintommoore. You are an inspiration to us all,‚Äù tweeted the official account of Lord‚Äôs Cricket Ground.

In a video call with Root, set up by SPORTbible, the England captain asked Moore to ‚Äúgive a team-talk to get all the lads in the right frame of mind‚Äù once international cricket is back on track.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a huge inspiration to me,‚Äù said Root. The 99-year-old responded: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking forward to the time when you‚Äôve got the Australians about ‚Äì and you‚Äôre routing them, as I‚Äôm sure you will.‚Äù

Root also said he‚Äôd be sending the veteran a signed shirt from England‚Äôs 2019 World Cup victory.

Moore has pledged to keep on walking as long as the donations are coming in. He could be on his way up the music charts with a recording of You‚Äôll Never Walk Alone with Michael Ball, and has also been invited to visit racing car firm McLaren‚Äôs headquarters.

Deakin University, Australia has announced relief measures for international students who are experiencing hardship due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Deakin has announced up to AUD 25 million in additional targeted support for international students who might be facing hardships due to COVID-19.

Vice-Chancellor professor Iain Martin said, ‚ÄúMany international students, in these uncertain times and through no fault of their own, are struggling with the costs of living and studying. We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with each one of our international students. I hope this additional support will help them to tide over their hardships.

We want to ensure that all of them are safe and equipped with all the necessary resources. For those who are reaching out to us, we are tailoring our support if the case demands it. I would like to emphasize that the safety and wellbeing of our student community remain our top priority, and we are doing everything possible to support them, during this difficult time.‚Äù

The University has also ramped up its support services and continues its offering of 20 per cent and 25 per cent fee waiver scholarships.

It was not clear how the virus had jumped the species barrier to humans but there had ‚Äúcertainly‚Äù been an intermediate animal host.

The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday that all available evidence suggests the novel coronavirus originated in animals in China late last year and was not manipulated or produced in a laboratory.

US President Donald Trump said last week that his government was trying to determine whether the virus emanated from a lab in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus pandemic emerged in December.

‚ÄúAll available evidence suggests the virus has an animal origin and is not manipulated or constructed in a lab or somewhere else,‚Äù WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib told a Geneva news briefing. ‚ÄúIt is probable, likely, that the virus is of animal origin.‚Äù

It was not clear, Chaib added, how the virus had jumped the species barrier to humans but there had ‚Äúcertainly‚Äù been an intermediate animal host. ‚ÄúIt most likely has its ecological reservoir in bats but how the virus came from bats to humans is still to be seen and discovered.‚Äù

She did not respond to a request to elaborate on whether it was possible the virus may have inadvertently escaped from a lab. The Wuhan Institute of Virology has dismissed rumours both that it synthesized the virus or allowed it to escape.

Chaib, asked about the impact of Trump‚Äôs decision last week to suspend funding to the U.N. agency over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic, said: ‚ÄúWe are still assessing the situation about the announcement by President Trump ‚Ä¶and we will assess the situation and we will work with our partners to fill any gaps.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt is very important to continue what we are doing not only for COVID but for many, many, many, many other health programmes,‚Äù she added, referring to action against polio, HIV and malaria among other diseases.

She said that the WHO was 81 percent funded for the next two years as of the end of March, referring to its $4.8 billion biennial budget. The United States is the Geneva-based agency‚Äôs biggest donor. Other big contributors are the Gates Foundation and Britain.

While ‚ÄòThe Flying Sikh‚Äô Milkha Singh and his wife Nirmal Kaur are at their Sector 8 home in Chandigarh along with their son Jeev Milkha Singh following the nationwide lockdown, the 90-year-old former athlete‚Äôs second oldest daughter Dr Mona Singh has been busy treating coronavirus patients at the Metropolitan Hospital in New York for the last 45 days.

With New York, one of the worst-hit cities in the US, seeing around 1,30,000 cases and 10,000 deaths, Dr Mona Singh, among the first responder to the Covid-19 patients, has been on 12-hour shifts at the Emergency Response ward of the Metropolitan hospital.

‚ÄúThe first few cases were diagnosed in New York in mid-March but then there were several cases with no symptoms. As an emergency physician, we are the first to respond to the Covid-19 patients and there are many challenges. The first is to drop the fear of getting infected and get used to the challenge of putting the PPE kit with full precautions. The third and the toughest challenge is to endure the emotional trauma of seeing young lives lost amid this pandemic. Though every life is worth saving, seeing young people die does leave mental scars. But then we as doctors regroup and sometimes talk to family members to channelise our thoughts. I talk with my family, including my father and brother Jeev Milkha Singh, and they always boost my confidence,‚Äù shared Dr Mona Singh, while talking over phone from New York.

Mona completed her medical degree from Patiala Medical College before shifting to the USA in the 1980s where she did her internship at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. At present, she is working as an Emergency Physician with the Metropolitan Hospital. With 111 ICU beds at present and 74 on the anvil, it is among the major facilities handling Covid patients in New York.

Her mother and former Indian volleyball captain Nirmal Mikha Singh confesses that initially she was worried. ‚ÄúBut Mona knows her work very well and is taking all possible precautions. She is among the 3-4 doctors who handle the Covid-19 patients on their arrival and provide breathing support to them.‚Äú

Youngest of Mona‚Äôs siblings and 14-time International title winner golfer Jeev Milkha Singh too makes it a point to have a word with his sister every day. ‚ÄúThe situation in USA has worsened with more than seven lakh cases and 40,000 deaths. In New York, cases of people shooting family members out of depression have also come up and Mona has also handled some gunshot wound patients amid responding to Covid-19 patients,‚Äù says Jeev, adding that doctors are humans too and are under tremendous stress. ‚ÄúSo I told her to do Sukhmani Sahib ji path twice daily,‚Äù shares Jeev.

Authorities on Wednesday launched an exercise to trace contacts of a 57-year-old trader who died of COVID-19 in north Delhi‚Äôs Azadpur Mandi as fear spread among people visiting the area.

North Delhi District Magistrate Deepak Shinde said surveillance teams have started tracing contacts of the man from Azadpur Mandi, Asia‚Äôs largest wholesale vegetable and fruit market, and his family.

The district magistrate said COVID-19 tests will be conducted on all high-risk contacts by the district administration.

The trader was tested positive on Monday after his sample was collected on April. He died of the infection on Tuesday

The business partner of the deceased said 20 people worked with him at the mandi, which spreads around 80 acres.

Earlier this week, the Delhi government decided to allow Azadpur Mandi to operate round-the-clock, a move aimed at providing relief to farmers and traders amid lockdown to curb the coronavirus outbreak.

According to the government‚Äôs decision, vegetables and fruits are being sold from 6 am to 10 pm and thereafter, trucks are allowed to enter the market between 10 pm and 6 am.

The total number of coronavirus cases in the national capital rose to 2,156 on Tuesday, with 75 new cases being reported.

It was the first time since April 8 that no fresh death due to the disease was reported in the city.

In a bid to ease pressure on hospitals, Pune district authorities are considering a move to reserve hospital beds for critically-ill COVID-19 patients while accommodating those who have tested positive but are asymptomatic to a simple hospice-like facility. ‚ÄúWe are even thinking of discharging them after a week or so,‚Äù District Collector Naval Kishore Ram told The Indian Express.

On Tuesday, a meeting ‚Äî chaired by Dr Subhash Salunkhe, chairman of the Communicable Diseases Prevention and Control Technical Committee ‚Äî with senior personnel from various private hospitals was held at B J Medical College to take note of their grievances, and issues they are facing while treating COVID-19 patients.

‚ÄúThese are extraordinary times and my appeal to private hospitals is to bear the treatment cost for a while. On the lines of treatment provided to H1N1 virus (swine flu) patients‚Ä¶ when the reimbursement was done after the review by experts, we are also working out a similar policy move on the issue,‚Äù Ram said. There is a need to utilise COVID care centres, where, based on the doctor‚Äôs advice, those who have tested positive but have mild symptoms can be kept under observation, said district authorities.

Dr Salunkhe said a committee has been set up to look into the issues of providing remuneration to private hospitals for treating COVID-19 patients. He also pointed out that those who have tested positive with COVID-19 but are in the ‚ÄòC‚Äô category of patients, with mild symptoms, do not require to be admitted to hospitals but can be placed in COVID care centres. ‚ÄúPrivate hospitals need to reserve more beds for those who require intervention, oxygenation and for critically-ill COVID-19 patients,‚Äù Dr Salunkhe said.

Urging hospitals not to turn away patients, he said, ‚ÄúThere have been reports of big hospitals turning away patients as they did not have sufficient beds, but that should no longer be the case. We must ensure that such situations do not arise.‚Äù

According to district administration officials, if a flu/fever clinic identifies that a person is not critical but has COVID-19 symptoms, he or she should be sent to COVID care centre after taking their swab samples. ‚ÄúWe are taking inputs from private hospitals‚Ä¶ and taking help of technology to identify area-wise hospitals where patients can be sent,‚Äù said an official.

At Ruby Hall Clinic, which has done screening of its staff and detected 27 of them positive with COVID-19, medical director Dr Sanjay Pathare, who attended the meeting, said a majority of them were carriers. ‚ÄúHowever, they are asymptomatic and do not require hospitalisation,‚Äù he said.

In Pune, over 800 persons have tested positive for COVID-19 and a majority of them are admitted in Symbiosis International Hospital, Bharati Hospital and Sassoon General Hospital. Dr Sanjay Lalwani, medical director at Bharati Hospital, said at least 12 hospitals with 50 ICU beds should be identified along with another 10 to 12 hospitals with 25 ICU beds so that ‚Äúintensive care treatment can be made immediately available‚Äù. He added, ‚ÄúCases need to be picked up early and referred to appropriate hospitals with a dedicated team of super specialists.‚Äù

‚ÄúHospitals are staring at a financial loss and we need to ensure providing personal protective equipment to our staff,‚Äù said Dr H K Sale, executive director at Noble Hospital.

Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director at Sahyadri Specialty hospital, suggested that daily remuneration to the tune of Rs 35,000 and Rs 15,000 could be given for a critical COVID-19 patient and non-critical patient, respectively.

Meanwhile, after two private hospitals denied treatment to a 40-year-old suspected COVID-19 patient, Sassoon Hospital sent him to Symbiosis Hospital, where he is on intensive care.

Dr Vijay Natarajan, CEO at Symbiosis hospital, said, ‚ÄúHe was admitted to our hospital at 9 pm on Sunday and the swab tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday. He is on intensive care and all four ventilators are now occupied at the hospital.‚Äù Dr Natarajan added that patients with severe acute respiratory illness should not be denied treatment just because of the possibility of being a suspected COVID-19 patient.

On April 18, a 76-year-old woman had died of cardiac arrest. Her family members claimed two large hospitals refused to admit her after her chest X-ray had a pneumonia patch. ‚ÄúFrom 3 pm to 6 pm, I was in an ambulance seeking treatment for my mother. She died on the way to a third hospital,‚Äù the woman‚Äôs son told The Indian Express.

Anil and Jyoti will always remember how they began their married lives ‚Äì walking out of a police station in the midst of a lockdown against a virus. Their marriage ceremony took place Monday on the premises of Dheena police station in Uttar Pradesh‚Äôs Chandauli district.

Anil, who is from Mahuji village in Chandauli district, and Jyoti from Ghazipur district tied the knot at a Shiva temple located inside the police station complex. ‚ÄúIt was a marriage with limited means and five people each from the groom‚Äôs side and from the bride‚Äôs side were present during the ceremony,‚Äù SHO Rajesh Kumar told PTI.

Police were returning a favour to the couple. Anil had helped them during a boat tragedy in February, saving several people from drowning. His role was lauded by senior officials of the police and the district administration.

‚ÄúAnil‚Äôs marriage with Jyoti was already fixed for April 20. However, the imposition of the nationwide lockdown and its subsequent extension worried him. He then contacted us and sought a solution,‚Äù the SHO said.

Police reminded him about the restrictions on gatherings. ‚ÄúAnil then asked us whether his marriage could be solemnised at the Shiva temple inside the police station compound,‚Äù Kumar said.

He assured police that only five people from each side will take part in the ceremony. ‚ÄúOn this condition, we gave our nod,‚Äù Kumar said.

The decision to hold the wedding at the police station was taken just a couple of days before the event. Senior police officials including the additional superintendent of police, circle officer and in-charge of a police outpost were present during the marriage.

‚ÄúThe event, though with limited means, was solemnised amidst the chanting of Vedic mantras, while strictly adhering to social distancing norms,‚Äù the police officer said. ‚ÄúUnlike the usual time-consuming, elaborate rituals in Hindu marriages, this marriage was relatively shorter,‚Äù he added.

The order came the State Cabinet‚Äôs decision in this regard on April 19 considering the hardships faced by parents due to the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown. Following the order, Commissioner for School Education, Ch Ramana Kumar, issued directions for creation of a call centre for grievances between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. on all working days. He also urged disposal of the complaints within 24 hours after duly verifying from field officers.

After such orders were issued by states like Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab, and Tamil Nadu, etc. several people had taken to Twitter tagging municipal administration and IT minister KT Rama Rao with similar requests.

Though the decision has come in the backdrop of a COVID pandemic, the latest order has come as a major relief for members of the Hyderabad School Parents Association(HSPA) whose fight against school fee hike is nearly a decade-long.

Thanking chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, a statement from HSPA said: ‚ÄúWhile we have no doubts concerning the noble intention of the government and the Chief Minister, we are unable to ignore the previous bitter experience wherein similar orders issued by the government were waylaid by the powerful lobby of schools and our never-ending judicial process.‚Äù

They were referring to an order dated January 4, 2018, ordering schools to withhold fee hikes for the academic year 2018-19. According to HSPA members, the government order was challenged by the school management in the Court and a stay order was granted. The High Court finally heard the HSPA‚Äôs case after two full years in March 2020 and

ordered the Government to come up with a comprehensive policy on School fee regulation by April 9, 2020, they said.

HSPA vice-president Seema told indianexpress.com that the court has ordered the schools to deposit the amount of hiked fee from the year 2018 in separate bank accounts and prevented any use of the same. ‚ÄúMore than half of the schools have already collected the fee. Some schools have communicated with parents that the excess fee collected

will be adjusted in fee for later months. We want the government to clarify on this without leaving it to individual schools to take such decisions,‚Äù she said.

As much as the HSPA welcomes the latest order, it says it needs to be backed with the needed legal strength to prevent judicial intervention. The government has to come out soon with a comprehensive policy for school fee regulation ‚Äì as has been ordered by the High Court of Telangana

In order to address the needs of the migrant workers stuck in the city due to the extension of nationwide lockdown, Rachakonda police in Telangana has collaborated with the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS-Hyderabad) to conduct a socio-economic profiling and need assessment survey of workers.

On Wednesday, a team of six faculty members from TISS-Hyderabad, along with volunteers from the Rachakonda Security Council (RKSC), surveyed 132 households/groups with a total population of 496 people in Shanti Nagar within Jawahar Nagar police station limits. Natives of Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and West Bengal, etc in these clusters.

Calling migrant laborers the underbelly of the Indian economy, Professor U Vindhya, Deputy Director of TISS-Hyderabad, said the absence of any data on them is what led to the idea of taking up a rapid need assessment. Speaking to indianexpress.com, Professor Vindhya said, ‚ÄúThere is a dearth of data on the plight of migrant laborers from all over India. We thought we could make a beginning by doing a quick survey of different migrant groups in Hyderabad.‚Äù

The broad framework of their survey is the socio-economic inequality and disadvantage in society. ‚ÄúBut we are not going into all their needs but doing a rapid need assessment so that we can prepare a set of concrete recommendations for the government,‚Äù she added.

The survey has 35 questions, seeking information about their occupation, housing conditions, their most important current needs, and also what that they would like from the government, be it just food, money, or the certainty of their job post lockdown. There are also questions to find out the status of their indebtedness, if they send money home, etc. Finally, it also tries to find out what kind of relief has been distributed to them so far.

Rachakonda Police Commissioner Mahesh Bhagwat said as part of the continuous efforts to ensure that people in distress, especially migrant workers, the police department have made elaborate arrangements for the supply of food and other relief materials in its jurisdiction. While relief materials such as cooked food, groceries, and medical facilities are reaching the people, many other social parameters are emerging out of anxiety among these sections of people, he said in a statement.

On the survey, he said the enumeration of this data can further strengthen the current efforts of Rachakonda Police in plugging gaps and avoiding duplication of services.

On April 14, hours after the PM‚Äôs address on extending the lockdown, over 120 migrant workers were found walking from Hyderabad to Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh, and were sent back to their shelters after state minister Talasani Srinivas Yadav, Uppal MLA Subhash Reddy and other officials intervened and stopped them near Uppal. Groups of migrants were also stopped and sent back from Pathangi, Radhika crossroads, RK Puram, and Charminar.

The Telangana Government has also announced Rs 500 and 12 kg rice to migrant workers.

In a statement, the Commissioner of Police Anjani Kumar warned that any person assaulting a doctor would be arrested and sent to jail immediately. He said Hyderabad City police is committed to taking prompt action against any person who assaults a doctor or any medical staff in any of the hospitals. In these challenging times, doctors

and the entire medical staff are true leaders of the society.

The incident took place on Tuesday afternoon when attendants of a person awaiting results of COVID-19 tests at the isolation ward of Osmania General Hospital assaulted the junior doctor on duty insisting that their kin be discharged immediately. This was following results of two other patients in the ward which came positive. They feared that those admitted in the ward may contract the infection from those tested positive for coronavirus.

https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/coronavirus-police-democracy-economy-nation-after-lockdown-6373072/,"Not many would realise today, much less agree, that the lockdown will prove to be a most dangerous experiment in our democracy. Not many would realise today, much less agree, that the lockdown will prove to be a most dangerous experiment in our democracy.

As the country reels under the second instalment of an unprecedented lockdown, it may be worthwhile to look at the critical areas where the lockdown has been successful ‚Äî and what that success means. Let us leave aside the claim that the lockdown has kept the spread of the coronavirus under control. Partly because that ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù would not have called for an extension of the lockdown and also because experts may tell us that the virus may not be so easily tamed ‚Äî it will stay with us for quite some time and raise its head again and again. But victory in the ‚Äúwar‚Äù against the virus notwithstanding, whenever India resumes a semblance of normalcy, it would be a new normal. The normal of the future would be based on three successful narratives of the past four weeks.

The first is an unspoken but pervasive narrative. It is about what we do with democracy. A future historian would surely report that it was an extraordinary exercise to more or less bring to a standstill a continental country, putting a mammoth population into home-captivity. What does this success signify? In the urgent enthusiasm to ensure a national fight against the pandemic, smaller voices about cross-party consultation, federal principles, judicial oversight, are all consigned to outdated textbooks of politics and governance. Even as the second phase of the lockdown unfolds, the MHA is fuming that Kerala is not following the Centre‚Äôs plan but adopting its own. Clearly, there is only one fount of wisdom, one source of policy, one centre of power.

Sanjaya Baru writes: Management of lockdown, its aftermath, will shape balance of power between Centre and states

There are no questions asked as to what gave which government the authority to clamp the lockdown. No discussion on whether the disaster management act should be covering epidemic situations. Nobody seems worried that we do not have a democratically legislated epidemic diseases act and rely on a colonial era act. Political parties are oblivious to these issues. Public discussions bypass these procedural matters. We have installed a hierarchy of principles: Results count, procedures don‚Äôt matter. It has been somewhat mildly described by one scholar as an ‚Äúexecutive emergency‚Äù.

Not many would realise today, much less agree, that the lockdown will prove to be a most dangerous experiment in our democracy. This is not about just the central government, or the ruling party. The frightening success of the lockdown is the willingness of the entire ruling class and the articulate public in the gigantic suspension of democracy. The swift ability with which the civil and police bureaucracy could be mobilised in the efforts to push the entire population into home lock-up should be a model lesson for any future autocrat. It would be a tough task for India to come out of the mental-intellectual lockdown that it has willingly accepted. Not surprisingly, a petition in the Supreme Court has asked for an order to deploy the military to implement the lockdown.

This is not to argue that the COVID threat should not have invoked a firm policy of physical distancing; the argument is about the fallout. We now have a template for undermining democracy: Talk about a public cause, about public well-being and obtain approval for abandoning core principles of democracy. Today, it might appear to be a justifiable move ‚Äî indeed, both the media and Opposition have said so and the public has acquiesced. What guarantee do we have that our future democracy will not be governed by this narrative of nationally necessary democratic curtailment?

Two other narratives stem from our very own social distancing project. One pertains to the long existing distance between Hindus and Muslims. Everything possible is being done to ensure that this social distance would increase in a manner that it would be difficult for the two communities to peacefully co-exist. The irresponsible gathering of the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi only added to the vicious distancing. Seizing that moment, but unrelated to it, was the Muslim-bashing that ensued in the backdrop of the Delhi riots just before the corona outbreak. If you recall that the anti-CAA protests were continuously branded as Muslim protests, and worse, a conspiracy against India, the pattern becomes clear.

Not just social media but the electronic and print media, too, enthusiastically latched on to the Hindu-Muslim divide in presenting the spread of corona and the violations of the lockdown. Over the past four weeks a narrative has made a deep impact: That everything must be seen through the prism of religious communities; that Muslims are conspiring against Indian interest ‚Äî so much so that terms like ‚Äúcorona jihad‚Äù came into circulation and no government made any effort to stem this ugly communal virus. The narrative is not new, but its traction should be noted as a direct contribution of the current moment. We are now perhaps just a step away from the socio-economic boycott of Muslims in many parts of the country. Once that has happened, we shall have achieved complete success in the century-long project of social distancing.

Opinion | The corona crisis threatens to write the obituary of global capitalism. It will have a lasting impact on national economic strategies and politics

Equally disturbingly, the lockdown has ensured that the class-chasm would become more real, more sharp and yet politically infructuous. The overwhelming support that the lockdown has received among India‚Äôs middle classes is noteworthy not just because of the gullibility of that class but also because of its complete lack of social connection to anything beyond itself. Over the last four weeks, many stories of dislocation, destitution and starvation have emerged; information about stranded labourers is flowing in. But middle class conscience has not found it necessary to take this into account. We stop at personal acts of kindness, celebration of philanthropy and a quick lapse into amnesia. Politics of and for the poor has become inadmissible. Politics does not demand that any measure against COVID must, as its first priority, include a decent policy space to address the difficulties of the vulnerable sections. This is not to say that Indian politics was ever really sensitive about the poor; but now, even the cynical possibility of electoral gains does not push parties to fight for the rights of the poor.

This double social distancing ‚Äî of the majority community from the minority and of the vocal and influential classes from the mass of the poor ‚Äî sits well with the narrative of cutting democracy to size. In a majoritarian and middle-class driven social universe, the place of democracy is bound to be marginal, if not nominal. We began this ‚Äúwar‚Äù with the convenient platitude of ‚Äújaan hai to jahaan hai‚Äù (we can think of wellbeing only if we live). In turning this platitude into ‚Äújaan aur jahaan‚Äù later, we admitted that we might be losing both lives and livelihoods. In the midst of that very real possibility, we are on the verge of being haunted by the three narratives: Minimise democracy, maximise interfaith distance and maintain aloofness from the poor. Will that be the shape of life after lockdown?

At the beginning of the Great Depression, Lenin was leading the revolution in Russia. He argued that capitalism reached its highest stage in monopoly capitalism and thereafter, became parasitic and moribund.

April 22, 2020, marks the 150th birth anniversary of V I Lenin. He was one of the greatest theoreticians of Left politics after Karl Marx. He was an excellent strategist and tactician, who led the first socialist revolution in 1917, in Russia. He was the head of the first socialist country and founder of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). While it is appropriate that the working people of the world pay their tributes to the leader who changed the course of history by establishing a government of the working classes and laid the foundation for a new social order, there is a need to look at socialism in the context of the ongoing debate on the world post-Covid.

The lockdown forced by the corona epidemic has triggered agitations by the hungry, homeless and jobless poor and migrant workers in many countries, including the US. Many scholars are recalling the Great Depression while debating the impact the pandemic is likely to have on the global economy. The Great Depression is conventionally dated from October 28, 1929, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 20 per cent in a single day. However, the depression began in the first decades of the 20th century. The crisis of overproduction and over-accumulation led to the collapse of purchasing power and investment, creating massive unemployment and other related problems. The economic depression during 1929-32 shook all of Europe and the US. During this period the economy of the US was in competition and conflict with Europe, generating homelessness, migration, hunger and unimaginable miseries. The crisis of capitalism and the conflict among the capitalist countries led to World War I. Half a century earlier, Marx had published the first volume of Capital, in which he established that capitalism is a crisis-ridden economic system.

Opinion | Minimise democracy, maximise interfaith distance, maintain aloofness from poor ‚Äî may be the new normal

At the beginning of the Great Depression, Lenin was leading the revolution in Russia. He argued that capitalism reached its highest stage in monopoly capitalism and thereafter, became parasitic and moribund. His work, Imperialism: The highest stage of capitalism, was a response to the crisis. The October Revolution was waged in the backdrop of the Great Depression and World War I. The USSR was projected as an alternative to the capitalist order that ensured equality and justice to all.

It‚Äôs now 90 years since the Great Depression. Those experiences and lessons are relevant even today. The current stage of capitalist development has created unprecedented income and wealth inequality within the country and among the nations. Capitalism is in deep crisis. The world, after corona recedes, is not going to be the same. The economic crisis may worsen.

It is imperative to reflect on the economic ramifications of this evolving scenario in India. Even in the name of the coronavirus, attempts are on to spread fear and terror among the people in the name of religion. From Buddha to Ravidas and further to Ambedkar, there has been the enduring dream of Begumpura. In our times, Begumpura is the New India where people reside without fear and dread, worries and sufferings. Marx and Lenin would not hesitate to align with these leaders and thinkers of our country. But corporate capitalism will not allow any alternative outside the capitalist structure. Right-wing forces have already captured power in many countries, including India. These forces will dismantle democracy by encouraging fascist forces who claim to act in the name of radical national renewal.

When we pay tributes to Lenin, we should not fail to think about ways to liberate people from all kinds of exploitations and enslavement.

Imagine in the midst of the Cuban missile crisis (that almost pushed the US and Soviet Union into a nuclear confrontation) there was an outbreak of the Spanish flu and the US was still on the gold standard. The current crisis needs to be appreciated by India similarly. It requires a medical cure to kill the fear, effective economic actions and sophisticated geopolitical navigation. We all recognise that until an anti-viral is found, there will be fear, and life will return to normal only after a vaccine is available at scale.

The virus currently has many more unknowns than knowns. We don‚Äôt know for sure how it spreads, whether people can get re-infected, whether it is mutating, whether the hot weather kills it, and what the real fatality rate is. We don‚Äôt know for sure how far we are from an anti-viral. We know, however, that we are at least 18 months away from having a vaccine that works and is available at scale. Till an anti-viral is found, economic activity will be constrained, and this will affect people, industries and countries in disparate ways.

The global economy is set to lose close to ten trillion dollars because of the ‚Äúself-induced coma‚Äù it has been put into ‚Äî to use Paul Krugman‚Äôs evocative phrase. The preceding global financial crisis (GFC) has exhausted the efficacy of monetary tools. In addition, corporates globally are leveraged to the tune of $12 trillion. The accompanying oil price collapse (beginning due to a spat between producers Saudi Arabia and Russia) has been compounded by a precipitous slump in demand. The Chinese economy can‚Äôt help as it did during the GFC, as it is hemmed in itself. Even if it could, there is too much global suspicion of China to allow it to do so. So, countries will largely be on their own.

The tensions between the US and China have escalated into a full-scale superpower crisis after the virus spread. Since 2010, there has been great concern in the US about China‚Äôs rise. China‚Äôs muscular foreign policy together with its aggressive stance on multiple issues, most importantly on technology and technology standards, has created conflict. The rhetoric, now, is likely to be a polarising one with the coronavirus spreading in the US in an election year, smashing its economy, infecting over three-quarter of a million people in the country and killing more than 40,000 ‚Äî China could be seen as enemy number one in the US.

No wonder then that at a time when the world yearns for global coordination, there is almost none ‚Äî in healthcare responses (lockdown to guided restrictions) and economic coordination (from 1 to 18 per cent of GDP responses). Multilateral agencies, especially the WHO and UN, suffer a complete loss of credibility. India needs to chart its own course in these turbulent times. My belief is that if India takes the requisite actions it may come out well, belying the predictions of the Cassandras.

Sanjaya Baru writes: Management of lockdown, its aftermath, will shape balance of power between Centre and states

We need to act at three levels ‚Äî health, economic and geopolitical. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has done well to stem the spread of the infection. It has used Indian jugaad in deploying the country‚Äôs modest healthcare resources efficiently to deal with the pandemic. It has sensitised the public, introduced the concept of social distancing and isolation in the most challenging situations. Now it must test at scale and isolate. But Indians cannot afford to stay locked much longer. We are too poor and too many of us live on a day-to-day basis ‚Äî not even on a paycheck to paycheck basis. We are hardy, young and understand self-preservation, and will learn to cope. Economic activity will be subdued in the near-term, but it must be ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù.

The current IMF projections suggest that India will have the highest growth rate in the world this year. I believe they are right if we act. Oil prices have collapsed, really helping our balance of payments. Our food stocks are plentiful, the rabi crop has been good, and the prognosis for the monsoon is positive. This, together with the fact that aggregate demand is down, will dampen inflationary impulses. The ‚Äúnew RBI‚Äù has acted boldly and strongly. It has taken prompt actions to reduce rates, increase liquidity, adjust prudential norms, allow moratoriums, and protect financial entities. The weakened rupee will help our exports and with a debt to GDP ratio of about 73 per cent, along with better growth prospects, India is relatively better placed than several other countries. We should, therefore, not unduly worry about our credit rating. This both allows and actually requires the government to act on the fiscal front.

The government needs to implement the following four steps to spur the economy. It should do so by ‚Äúprinting money‚Äù given the moderated inflation impulses. It needs to provide additional direct benefit transfers of Rs 2,000 every month for three months to Jan Dhan accounts, together with foodgrains release from the FCI, to the tune of around Rs 65,000 crore, to alleviate people‚Äôs miseries. It needs to protect MSMEs directly by providing them working capital (with an RBI backstop) and, like in the UK, provide 80 per cent of the salary to employees of the ‚ÄúGST-paying MSMEs‚Äù for six months (if the employees were on their rolls in February). It needs to launch a massive public works programme (in the nature of the New Deal of FDR) outside the Budget as suggested by the chairman of CII‚Äôs National Committee of Infrastructure and PPP, Vinayak Chatterjee. This fund should be earmarked for infrastructure and a quarter of its budget should be set aside for strengthening and upgrading primary health centres. The allocation should not be less than Rs 200,000 crore.

The government should take advantage of the crisis to push through much needed pending reforms in agriculture (especially those pertaining to APMC), power (pricing and discoms), banks (government ownership at 30 per cent and bad banks). Given the paucity of tax revenues, the government should be willing to print money but it could also consider having the PM making an appeal for private gold from people and temples (no questions asked) ‚Äî it could target 1,000 tonnes of gold worth $30 billion and offer a five per cent tax-free return repayable ($1.5 billion a year) after 10 years, in rupees or gold.

We can come out ahead if we act now. Super-power rivalries will create opportunities to replace China as a major supplier to the US and Japan. But first, we must survive. We can then re-imagine and thrive.

As we remain under lockdown, it is vital that all Indians display cooperation to show the world that we can defeat the COVID-19 pandemic, just as we eradicated smallpox and polio. Every citizen must follow physical distancing for at least the next year and maintain hygiene, especially in terms of handwashing and/or using hand sanitiser. Indians may have the BCG vaccine and inbuilt/innate immunity as an advantage, but we are allowing these gains to be frittered away because of our poor hygiene.

Indians have robust inbuilt immunity thanks to the country‚Äôs adverse environment but that needs to now be built upon through lifestyle-related measures. Indian cuisine is rich in spices and condiments. Protein-rich and traditional diets, which every community possesses, are the best option in the current circumstances. There are exercises that can be performed while being locked in ‚Äî yoga, pranayama, surya namaskars and even simple sit-ups can help build our muscles to fight the virus. Studies have repeatedly shown that adequate sleep ‚Äî for eight hours ‚Äî helps fight respiratory viruses, including COVID-19.

Opinion | Super-power rivalries exacerbated by coronavirus pandemic offer India an opportunity

This is also the ideal time to give up addictions to tobacco and alcohol. Hot-water gargles multiple times a day, avoiding refrigerated food as well as opening windows for fresh air is vital for health.

We are learning something new about COVID-19 each day. It spreads through airborne microdroplets, which are released via speaking, spitting, coughing and sneezing. So, covering our faces, noses and mouths with a cloth or mask and wearing glasses is the key to breaking the chain of transmission. We now also know that the gut is the second site of virus transmission and, therefore, clean toilets are the order of the day. Surfaces which we touch may be a source of transmission for the virus but this can be addressed by sanitiser and soap.

The greatest need is to protect those belonging to vulnerable groups from the virus. These include senior citizens, those with hypertension or other heart conditions, those with lung or kidney disease and others whose immunity may be low due to disease or medication like steroids. Such people need to remain home-bound and should be treated like VVIPs ‚Äî served and cared for like never before, while maintaining hygiene and distancing. At any sign of poor health, they must be rushed to the nearest healthcare facility. Ensure you connect with your healthcare providers digitally, avoid crowding at hospitals for routine care as the lockdown ends and emergency medical care continues.

COVID-19 has many experimental treatments from simple and cheap ones like chloroquine and deworming agents to expensive medications. Let‚Äôs leave that to the experts. It‚Äôs time we scale up our testing in all red zones and hot spots. Our research bodies like the ICMR should rapidly publish everything they know about the virus so that we can develop strategies to handle it better.

Coronavirus does not kill by itself. The co-morbidities, delays in test and a lack of access to care are what will lead to deaths, especially when it comes to people from the vulnerable groups. India is the world capital for the manufacture of generic medicines and we must allow Indian innovators to rapidly make antiviral medicines and vaccines. In an emergency, like the current pandemic, patent rules can be tweaked temporarily to save lives.

Opinion | Minimise democracy, maximise interfaith distance, maintain aloofness from poor ‚Äî may be the new normal

The key to successfully conquering the coronavirus is early detection, isolation and prompt treatment to delay the ‚Äúlung storm‚Äù (called cytokines storms). Treatment can also be done with simple medicines like hydroxychloroquine as well as through simple strategies like oxygenation and transfusions in later stages. India may not have sufficient ventilators but we have one of the best-trained medical forces. We have a large supply of oxygen, blood and clinical doctors and nurses to fight complications.

Digital India must be incorporated rapidly into Indian medical care so that we can use telemedicine to give home based-care for mild cases as well as monitor recovered, asymptomatic patients. This way, hospitals can be rapidly freed up for more deserving cases.

Hospital staff are at risk and it‚Äôs essential to provide them with the best personal protective equipment (PPE) as well as food and rest. All healthcare workers must have COVID testing done and rapid tests must be done in all hospital environments. The workforce should be rotated.

This is an ideal time to have private-public partnerships in healthcare and it‚Äôs only matter of time before we sail out of this pandemic. Food and shelter for all is a need for all Indians and governments must ensure rations reach everyone. Crowded clusters like slums urgently need mass prophylaxis with hydroxychloroquine on an experimental basis, as distancing is impossible in such areas. Through this, the virus load will be reduced in the community and lives will be saved.

Rumour mongering and cybercrime is on the rise and we will need new laws to be enacted soon to address these. We need a positive attitude to avoid corona anxiety, predominantly generated by electronic gadgets. We must have at least two hours a day free of screens. For better health, there‚Äôs always a smile, music and meditation.

Speed had become the most distinguishing feature of the globalised world in the 21st century. But now, COVID-19 has hit humanity like a huge speed breaker. It has compelled us to turn the spotlight inwards. With an unimaginably serious threat of vulnerability to the virus, the fear of coronavirus will, quite understandably, haunt us for a long time. This disease is going to alter not just our ways of thinking, but also the ways of conducting ourselves as individuals.

The changes that the global community may well be staring at, are multi-dimensional. Prior to COVID-19, our public and private lives were, increasingly, becoming more contrived, ‚Äúevent‚Äù centric: Post-pandemic, we will be compelled to control our itch for turning everything into a spectacle. And when such ‚Äúevents‚Äù are reduced, perhaps, the level of our Facebook activism will also be proportionately lowered. The way we celebrate, worship and engage socially will undergo some change.

Opinion | What makes COVID-19 deadly are co-morbidities, lack of hygiene and distancing

The ultra-individualist West is going to feel this sense of isolationism more. People in countries like India, where the culture of collectivism is more established, are more likely to withstand the tensions of this transformation. Because in India, there is near-perfect balance between individualism and privacy on the one hand, and collectivism and exposure on the other hand. Reconciling individualistic identities with their larger context is inherent to Indian philosophy. The essence of our great epics ‚Äî the Ramayana and the Mahabharata ‚Äî holds a mirror to this constant interplay between individualism and collectivism, which finally leads to a beautiful convergence.

In this context one has to see India‚Äôs remarkable role as the global community faces the COVID-19 challenge. India‚Äôs partnership with the global community has three main dimensions: It starts with the doctrinal and emotional, before moving on to the technical and knowledge-based dimension. Finally, it becomes about resource mobilisation and, in that sense, acquires a material dimension.

Devastated by the onslaught of COVID-19, the global community needed leadership that possess a firm resolve to face the challenge and a sensitive, healing touch. Prime Minister Narendra Modi‚Äôs initiatives, like the special SAARC meeting on COVID-19, creation of a special SAARC fund and the virtual G-20 summit added to the huge expectations of the world from India. A series of tele-conversations happened between PM Modi and the heads of governments from other countries ‚Äî this is testimony to how the global community is looking forward to a proactive role from India.

Opinion | Minimise democracy, maximise interfaith distance, maintain aloofness from poor ‚Äî may be the new normal

Since April 3, 2020, PM Modi has had telephonic discussions with a number of world leaders including the US president Donald Trump, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu, Australian PM Scott Morrison, Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, Spanish PM Pedro Sanchez Perez-Castejon, Bahrain‚Äôs King Hamad Bin Isa Al Khalifa, Japanese PM Shinzo Abe and the prime minister of Nepal, K P Sharma Oli. Issues like the status of COVID-19 pandemic, mutual support and facilitation as well as India‚Äôs steps to counter the pandemic figured in these dialogues.

India has helped many developing and underdeveloped countries with medicines and medical equipment, and has also tried to strengthen bilateral knowledge-relationship. It started with SAARC, and a major deliverable that‚Äôs underway is an information exchange platform (IEP) for SAARC countries. It is a platform to bring health professionals of SAARC countries closer and facilitate the exchange of information, knowledge, expertise, online training and best practices for combating the pandemic, in real time.

Besides helping developing countries, India is also engaging with countries like the US through collaboration in the areas of diagnostics and therapeutics of the disease. Under the existing bilateral collaboration in the healthcare sector, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in the US shared important reagents with the Translational Health Science and Technology Institute in Gurugram. Such cooperation is expected to play a big role in developing new therapeutics and testing reagents for COVID-19. Countries worst-hit by the COVID-19 crisis in the European Union and other parts of the world have been investing in multiple research projects. Currently, the MEA is in the process of identifying the scope of collaboration with countries on vaccines, diagnostics etc.

India‚Äôs resources and material help, extended to several countries majorly in the form of medicines, is also remarkable. Under India‚Äôs commitment of $10 million, medical supplies/equipment have been provided to Bhutan, Bangladesh, Maldives and Sri Lanka. They will shortly be provided to Afghanistan and Nepal too. Medical aid, in the form of select supplies from India, has also been sent to countries like Seychelles, Mauritius, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Nepal, Myanmar, and some African countries too, without compromising with the domestic need. When the US requested India, we supplied medicines to them too. The government has also cleared the export of COVID-19 drugs to countries such as Spain, Brazil, Bahrain, Germany and the UK, in line with the commercial contracts signed with Indian pharmaceutical companies.

Historically, India‚Äôs global role was never limited to Track-One or Track-Two diplomacies, to use established parlance. A remarkably confident, composed and, truly, ‚ÄúNew India‚Äù is today partnering with the world community in this global struggle ‚Äî and this partnership goes beyond established norms of diplomacy. What we are engaging in is, in fact, our endeavour to implement what we have always believed in: Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, the world is one family.

There is a growing body of opinion that in the post-COVID world most countries will see governments playing a larger role in shaping people‚Äôs lives and determining their livelihoods.

The Telugu Desam supremo, N T Rama Rao, once famously declared, ‚Äúthe Centre is a conceptual myth.‚Äù If Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not made his repeated post-lockdown appearances on television, most citizens dealing with the threat of COVID-19 and the challenge of the lockdown may well have felt the same way. From ensuring supply of water, food, electricity and health care to law and order, the government that a citizen deals with is the state government. Only in Delhi the police are under the Centre‚Äôs charge. The management of a sub-continental lockdown has brought into focus the role of state governments, their uneven capacities and capabilities and varying quality of provincial leadership ‚Äî both political and bureaucratic.

There is a growing body of opinion that in the post-COVID world most countries will see governments playing a larger role in shaping people‚Äôs lives and determining their livelihoods. The return of big government and the prospect of a potentially larger role for the state in the economy raises the question, certainly in India, of what it would mean for Centre-state relations, and for national and provincial politics. The central government‚Äôs role will no doubt be important in the handling of the economic and financial aftermath, in reviving inter-state movement of people and goods, in re-negotiating international economic treaties to make them relevant to the new situation and so on. However, the immediate challenge of public health and medical care, as well as the continued supply of necessities, will remain the responsibility of state governments.

The manner in which the central and state governments resolve the problem of inadequate fiscal resources, given falling revenues due to the slowdown and rising claims on the public exchequer, will be a key issue in Centre-state relations. Several chief ministers have been complaining about the Centre‚Äôs lack of fiscal nerve, resolve and imagination in helping states. Kerala Finance Minister Thomas Isaac has dubbed it ‚Äúcrazy macroeconomics‚Äù (‚ÄòAhead of the Covid curve‚Äô, IE, April 17). The Fifteenth Finance Commission, already given an extension and saddled with additional terms of reference, may have to look de novo at many new issues in federal finance given the fiscal imperatives of a post-COVID economy.

Editorial | Centre and states must sidestep conflict in crisis, agree on a common minimum programme on containment strategies

Given the constitutional division of responsibilities between the Centre and states, one issue that has fallen between two stools is the entire question of internal migration and the economic and social interests of domestic migrant labour. Historically, both home and host states have not acted responsibly in dealing with the welfare of migrant labour. Many states have, in fact, discriminated against migrant labour. The COVID lockdown has brought their welfare to the fore. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has ill-advisedly dissolved the National Development Council, but the problem of migration and migrant labour, especially in the current context, is a fit subject for a federal forum like the NDC to discuss.

Indian politics today presents a balance between the centripetal pull of the BJP‚Äôs Hindu nationalism and the centrifugal pull of regionalism. The management of the lockdown and its aftermath will determine the balance of power not just between Centre and the states, but between alternative political platforms. If chief ministers succeed in demonstrating their competence and compassion to their constituents, they can weaken the national base of a populist PM. Modi would surely be aware of this. In part, his media outreach may well be defined by his need to occupy public mind space at a time when most citizens are, in fact, turning to local political leadership for liberation from the lockdown.

In his first term, Prime Minister Modi was able to keep national attention focused on his foreign and economic policy initiatives as well as on national security and defence ‚Äì all areas within the purview of the Centre and offering the PM the space to act. Modi‚Äôs second term got off to a wrong start with public attention focused on law and order, questions of citizenship and personal health. These issues have opened up political space for provincial leadership. Not only has the profile of non-BJP chief ministers like K Chandrashekar Rao and Pinarayi Vijayan gone up, but even BJP chief ministers like Yogi Adityanath seem to have acquired a political personality of their own. At the same time, the unsure start of PM Modi‚Äôs second term, damaged by a variety of factors, has made a PM with more numbers less sure of himself, mimicking the experience of the second Manmohan Singh government.

Opinion | Moving House Online: How crucial legislative work could continue in crisis

Ideally, at a time like this, any PM would want to shift public attention back to foreign affairs and national security to burnish his national image. However, the current economic and fiscal situation at home and globally offers little space for significant diplomatic initiatives. Most governments will remain focused on domestic affairs and policies. This policy context opens up the space for provincial leaders.

During the ‚Äúera of coalitions‚Äù ‚Äî from 1989 to 2014 ‚Äî Centre-state relations were shaped by the decentralised politics of that period in which prime ministers were dependent on chief ministers both for their survival in office and to ensure delivery of public services and national initiatives. The arrival in office of a single party government, that too one headed by a domineering personality who has centralised governance while advocating ‚Äúcooperative federalism‚Äù, suggested for a while that Indian politics was moving in the direction of greater centralisation of policy initiative.

Ironically, however, the ability of regional parties to retain their base and the resurgence of the Congress party in some states, thanks to provincial leaders rather than the party‚Äôs First Family, has created a dual power structure wherein chief ministers have become powerful functionaries once again. It used to be like this in the early 1950s and later in the early 1970s when, first under Jawaharlal Nehru and then under Indira Gandhi, the country saw a powerful PM working with powerful CMs. Since the 1990s, a succession of relatively weak PMs have had to work with relatively powerful CMs. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh handled this situation by frequently interacting with CMs and regularly convening CMs‚Äô conferences. It was the COVID crisis that finally forced Modi to engage the CMs in an organised manner.

In the coming months, the focus of public policy will perforce shift to areas where state governments and provincial leaders will have to play a larger role. The only way in which the central government can re-assert its developmental role would be through massive public spending and investment. How competently that is done will have its own consequences for economic growth, political stability and Centre-state relations.

Express photo Jadav Gogoi, who travelled 2,900 km from Gujarat to Assam, is now quarantined at Nagaon‚Äôs BP Civil Hospital. Express photo

It is probably the first time in a month that Jadav Gogoi has smiled. And with good reason.

On Monday, Gogoi, a migrant worker from Assam, completed a journey of around 2,900 km, partly on foot, partly on a truck, battling storms, hunger and thieves to reach his hometown in Nagaon district.

‚ÄúAll I wanted to do was get home,‚Äù said a smiling Gogoi, on a video call from Nagaon‚Äôs BP Civil Hospital, where he is currently quarantined. Last month, when PM Narendra Modi announced the lockdown, Gogoi said the ‚Äúcompany‚Äù he worked at for six months in Gujarat ‚Äúchucked him out‚Äù. ‚ÄúThere was no food, nor money, markets were closed,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúIf I had stayed, I would have starved and died.‚Äù It was then that Gogoi, along with a group of other migrants ‚Äî none of whom was from Assam ‚Äî decided to make the long journey home.

‚ÄúYes he is in Nagaon, but we are trying to ascertain the exact route and where he came from,‚Äù said Abhijit Gurav, Nagaon SP.

‚ÄúWe have sent our officers to verify the facts,‚Äù said Nagaon DC Jadav Saikia. ‚ÄúOfficially we cannot comment on where he came from and how. We will know once we speak to him properly. He probably took a lift. It is unlikely he walked 3,000 km,‚Äù said Gurav.

Gogoi told his family he slept in bus stops, jironi ghors (rest houses that dot the highway), and ate when he was lucky. Gogoi told his family he slept in bus stops, jironi ghors (rest houses that dot the highway), and ate when he was lucky.

But the blisters on his feet tell another story ‚Äî even if the details are a little unclear in Gogoi‚Äôs head. ‚ÄúI walked, there was a truck but they did not carry me the whole way,‚Äù he said.

One of his co-travellers, Rakesh Kumar Yadav, a migrant worker from Varanasi confirmed that the group had left a place called Chandola (near Ahmedabad) together on March 25. ‚ÄúHe [Gogoi] used to stay near us. He did not have a phone, he did not speak much Hindi. But we knew him,‚Äù said Yadav, who worked in ‚Äòmedicine delivery‚Äô during his time in Gujarat. ‚ÄúSo we took a bus on March 25, then a truck and when we finally reached Varanasi, he said to us ‚Äòchale jaaonga‚Äô and he left. That is when I last saw him.‚Äù

But before that, Gogoi had used Yadav‚Äôs phone to call home. ‚ÄúIt was an unknown number and I was shocked to hear his voice,‚Äù said Rajen Phukan, Gogoi‚Äôs brother-in-law, who lives in Gadharia, the same village as Gogoi. ‚ÄúHe told me that he had reached Uttar Pradesh and he was going to catch a bus to Bihar, and then walk home to Nagaon ‚Äî to his wife and two children.‚Äù

Phukan said they were worried but did not know how to help or whom to call. ‚ÄúIt was a journey of 1,000 km. I told him it was a lockdown and that it was very dangerous to move around but he seemed to insist.‚Äù

Days passed and there was no news ‚Äî till on April 13, Gogoi called again, this time he announced that he had just entered Barpeta district, about 300 km away. ‚ÄúIs it Bihu?‚Äù Gogoi had asked Phukan, ‚ÄúI can see people dressed and celebrating.‚Äù

And this is how the week followed: sporadic calls from different locations, snippets of information, before he would just disappear. Gogoi told his family that he slept in bus-stops, jironi ghors (rest houses, open to the elements, that dot the highway), and ate only when he was lucky.

‚ÄúHe mostly survived on biscuits and tea. During the big storm after Bihu, he put a stool on his head and somehow saved himself,‚Äù says Jayshree, Phukan‚Äôs wife. ‚ÄúHe also said he was robbed of whatever money he had on the way‚Ä¶he told us he had set out with Rs 4,000.‚Äù

Explained | Indian migrants, across India

On April 19, Phukan received the final call from Gogoi. He had reached Ahotguri in Raha, about 45 km from Gadharia. ‚ÄúMy niece and a few boys from the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuva Chatra Parishad (AJYCP) alerted the police and rushed out in a car to fetch him,‚Äù said Phukan.

The group drove in the dark for about half an hour, till they spotted the man asleep in a jironi ghor (rest house) on the highway. ‚ÄúWe called out to him ‚Äî ‚Äòkhura (uncle), is that you?‚Äô‚Äù recalled Dibyajit Hazarika of AJYCP. ‚ÄúHe woke up and said ‚Äòhow did you find me? I have walked for long and I cannot go any further.‚Äô‚Äù

The Nagaon police immediately rushed him to the hospital where Gogoi was put in quarantine. ‚ÄúWe are testing him for COVID-19 and we expect the results tomorrow,‚Äù said J Ahmed, Superintendent of the Nagaon Civil Hospital, ‚ÄúHe seems okay but tired. We will keep him for the mandatory 14 day period at the least.‚Äù

Gogoi does not mind. ‚ÄúI am happy to be here,‚Äù he said. But how he got there is something he would rather not talk about. ‚ÄúI was hungry, I was cold ‚Ä¶ I really do not have more to say,‚Äù said Gogoi from the hospital bed. ‚ÄúBut one thing is for sure: never in my life will I step out of Assam again.‚Äù

They hope people will find their paintings educational and will be inspired by them to stay at safe distance from each other during the outbreak.

A group of children, at home during the nationwide lockdown, have taken to painting graffiti on the novel coronavirus in Agartala city to spread awareness about the disease.

‚ÄúWe know coronavirus is spreading around the world and India is not outside its affect. So, we, residents of Melarmath, are trying to paint graffiti on walls here to spread awareness about social distancing and need to say safe during the outbreak‚Äù, Sayantika Saha, a 5th standard school student from the city‚Äôs Melarmath area, told reporters this afternoon.

Several adults were also seen joining in with the kids to paint a few brush strokes as well.

Sreyashi Ghosh, Srijoya Saha and few other school students from the area, said they have taken to painting graffiti since mass gatherings were found to be the main cause of coronavirus spread in different parts of the country. They hope people will find their paintings educational and will be inspired by them to stay at safe distance from each other during the outbreak.

The paintings include animated images of COVID-19, people getting affected by it, scribbling resembling COVID-19 trying to attack the Indian map from different sides. Cartoons with mask-clad characters and slogans of ‚ÄòStay Home Stay Safe‚Äô also found place in the graffiti.

Most kids have used paints available at their homes. They wore masks on their faces and stood quite apart from each other, in an apparent move to maintain social distancing, as they went on with their painting.

Two persons have been tested positive with COVID-19 in Tripura so far, out of whom one has already recovered and was released from state-run GB Panth Hospital, where she was being treated. The other patient, a TSR jawan, is still under treatment.

The state government has repeatedly stressed on maintaining social distancing and staying indoors during the outbreak, even as restrictions on certain essential businesses were relaxed during the lockdown.

Whoever said charity begins at home has been absolutely correct. The future of the world, however bleak it may seem right now, can still be shaped by younger generations. Which is why, lessons in charity and good deeds are pertinent, especially now, given the circumstances.

Mumbai-based Tasneem, a teacher, and her six-year-old son Arhaan, for instance, have been doing their bit for a while now, to make life easier for those who are still showing up for work. ‚ÄúArhaan wrote a small poem a few days ago to thank the medical fraternity. We then sent it to a few doctors that we knew, posted it on Twitter, etc. It is not just about telling him, I am also making him watch the news so he understands what is going on and why we are thanking them,‚Äù Tasneem tells indianexpress.com.

By nature, children are curious. They want to know the whys and the whats. ‚ÄúHe has to understand the scenario. Healthcare workers are away from their families. And even if they do come home, they have to stay away from their children. Recently, we had the garbage collector come home to pick the garbage. My son had opened the door, and he said: ‚Äòoh, they are coming to work; they are not in lockdown?‚Äô That is when the talk started,‚Äù Tasneem says.

Tasneem has been telling her son that people who are working on the frontline are the real heroes. Arhaan, meanwhile, has been making videos thanking them. ‚ÄúIn our building we have the watchman and the gardener. Now, Arhaan asked me where they are getting their food from. The other day, he went down and gave them some biscuits; I allowed it because it was safe. He insisted we make tea ‚Äî I helped him and I don‚Äôt know how it tasted, but he tried and we went down and served them. He also served them water, because it was so hot and they were working outside,‚Äù she says.

In the last few days, heartwarming stories of children making contributions have made the rounds. For instance director Farah Khan‚Äôs 12-year-old son Czar Kunder, recently composed a song titled ‚ÄòNeed To Survive. His sisters Diva and Anya are believed to have directed and edited the video.

In the video, Czar raps extensively about the pandemic, finding a cure, how there still exist people who are not taking it seriously, and how humanity can only survive if it stays put until a cure is found. Khan‚Äôs daughter Anya, too, has been raising money by ‚Äúdiligently sketching for donations‚Äù.

Some time last month, this little boy from Mizoram also went viral on Twitter when it was found he had donated his entire savings of Rs 333 towards fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.

In Mumbai, meanwhile, 15-year-old Anoosha Sehgal has been making sure senior citizens are doing okay in lockdown. Through her initiative Stay Connected 2020, the 10th grader has been ensuring that the most vulnerable group is kept physically active, engaged, and entertained. She tells indianexpress.com that she gets experts on board to conduct sessions, which are streamed on platforms like Zoom, so the elderly can learn and stay engaged and connected real-time.

‚ÄúFor instance, we got a nutritionist on board to talk about healthy foods that they can eat. Besides doctors, we have also had entertaining sessions like singing, and we are planning to play housie sometime in the future. The group has as many as 220 people, and most of them are from Mumbai,‚Äù she says.

Sehgal says the idea to start this initiative came to her when she spoke with her grandparents, especially her nani, who is in New York, US right now. ‚ÄúShe is living in a small apartment and it gets really suffocating. She tells me she is getting antsy and annoyed being at home, and that she really wants to do something. She said she wanted to do drawing and yoga, and that is how I got the idea. Then, I spoke to my dadi here in Mumbai, and she said she wanted to sing,‚Äù she says, adding the engaging classes are held thrice a week ‚Äî on Mondays, Wednesdays and Friday ‚Äî for 30-40 minutes.

Parents can encourage their children to chat with grandparents as much as possible, says Rushabh Turakhia of Your Turn Now.

Rushabh Turakhia of Your Turn Now ‚Äî an initiative that encourages good deeds by passing on a card, suggesting it is now the other person‚Äôs turn now to do something good for somebody else and keep the chain going ‚Äî says parents alone can instill these values in kids. ‚ÄúThey do learn from schools, but ultimately they learn it from their parents. If parents want their kids to be down to earth and caring, they have to be polite themselves. Kids learn from what they observe,‚Äù he says.

Turakhia suggests parents can encourage their children to chat with grandparents as much as possible, and teach them about technology. They should do some gardening in the lockdown period, which can make them kinder towards the environment.

He also says that children should be encouraged to feel for birds and animals, and with summers already here, they should put a bowl of water outside for the birds. ‚ÄúKids can also be asked to clean out their own wardrobe, and make a bag of clothes, old toys, books, etc., which they wish to donate,‚Äù he says.

By Dr Nupur Gupta



Worried? Let‚Äôs work on a ‚Äònew you‚Äô for your ‚Äònew baby‚Äô. It can definitely happen with a good mental health hygiene, resulting in a happier and healthier mother and baby.

The current ongoing COVID 19 pandemic has changed the way we, as gynecologists, are managing antenatal care during pregnancy ‚Äî through online video consultations limiting exposure to the outside world. Our guidelines have been changing based on the evolving research. You too will adapt soon. Have faith.

According to CDC (Centre for Disease Control), pregnant women seem to have the same risk of contracting COVID 19 as any adult, so you are advised to follow the same protective measures. Get educated, engaged and empowered.

Pregnancy brings an unforgettable experience in life, but also some physical discomfort, weight gain, tiredness, fear of pain and labour. Nowadays, it is a visit to hospital for immunisation, consultation and tests. The feeling is like a caged bird, making us uncomfortable and restless. We can understand your experience of the current anxiety and confusion.

Not only pregnancy, this is a challenging time also for those who have no health issues.

Sharing tips to ward off stress, the most important is to accept the change. Anger, frustration and anxiety increase in a flight or fight mode.

‚Äì Have a regular routine, so it becomes a part of normalcy.

‚Äì Listen, read or watch news only twice a day.

‚Äì Get facts from trusted sources.

‚Äì Scientifically, meditation and yoga do help; make it your early morning schedule. They improve brain blood flow, increase production of positive hormones (endorphins) and decrease oxidative stress.

‚Äì Join online antenatal classes.

‚Äì Connect with one family member or a friend daily (phone call, video call, or email).

‚Äì Healthy well-balanced diet and being physically active should be your aim.

‚Äì Have a good night sleep (good sleep hygiene).

‚Äì Do an online course, rediscover your hobby, acquire a new skill.

‚Äì Ask for practical help if needed.

‚Äì Read books on motherhood.

‚Äì Connect with your unborn baby.

‚Äì Convert your fear into courage, poison into medicine and unlock your compassion and wisdom to help prevent the effects of stress on your immunity.

It is normal to feel sad, stressed, scared during such a crisis. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock) It is normal to feel sad, stressed, scared during such a crisis. (Source: Getty/Thinkstock)

‚Äì Relaxation and mindfulness will help

‚Äì it‚Äôs a good time to learn new technology, as an investment for your future.

‚Äì Make sure you have enough medicine for next 3 to 4 weeks and take it regularly.

‚Äì Consuming alcohol or smoking tobacco is not the answer.

‚Äì If you still feel anxious, confused or depressed, consider taking a session with a psychologist online.

‚Äì Remember, it is a physical lockdown for everyone, not a lockdown of your mind and soul, it is not a lockdown of help, hope and kindness.

‚Äì You can also help others and empower those around you.

‚Äì Another good news is that virus has not been seen to cross the placenta and affect the baby (no transplacental infection or vertical transmission has been reported till date).

ALSO READ | Can a mother with COVID-19 infection breastfeed her baby?

‚Äì Post delivery you can look for online classes for newborn care, lactation, counselling, and new mom support groups.

General Tips



‚Äì Cancel all your non-essential visits.

‚Äì Practice physical distancing.

‚Äì Understand the importance of hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene.

‚Äì Contact your doctor if you develop symptoms of fever, cough and breathing difficulty.

‚Äì Post-delivery, continue to take tele-medicine services.

Let‚Äôs learn to cope with our new reality of being in this virtual life that includes virtual work, virtual consultations, virtual exercise lesson and virtual family and friend meets. It is normal to feel sad, stressed, scared during such a crisis. To conclude, be in touch your obstetrician and ask for help when needed. Be in touch with accurate and up to date information.

Being nosy is good, to pry is better, meddling is welcome and to question and challenge is the best. Oh! Not in the affairs of others but in the world around us. The fact that ‚ÄúScience is simply a word we use to describe a method of organizing our curiosity‚Äù is quite relevant in current times and giving our children as many opportunities to explore and learn by doing and inquiring fires their imagination thus inculcating critical thinking and logical reasoning.

The Indian constitution also prescribes ‚ÄúScientific Temper with Humanism‚Äù as a fundamental duty which serves a key driver to invite and guide our children in their quest to explore the wonders of science.

Simple activities like these can enlighten and delight our children, thus lending them the requisite support to become successful scientific thinkers.

The Fiery Seesaw

The action of the Fiery Seesaw comes from the changing mass of the candles ‚Äî potential energy that gets converted into rotational kinetic energy.

As one end of the candle in the seesaw moves downward, the angled flame causes the wax to melt faster and drip more. As the dripping candle loses enough mass, it also loses potential energy which gets converted to kinetic energy and moves upward and the process is repeated.

Materials required

1. Long candle or two small candles

2. Sewing needle

3. 2 tall glasses that are of the same height

4. Aluminium foil or a tray/plate

Activity

Expose wick at both ends of the candle.

Put a large piece of aluminium foil/ tray on your work area.

Place the two glasses next to each other in the middle of the aluminium foil.

Pierce the needle through the candle about halfway down its length.

Balance the needles and candle between a pair of glasses.

Light one end of the needle and thereafter light the other end.

Exploration

Why does a candle even burn? (Combustion)

Under what condition is it possible that there is no movement in the candle?

The seesaw is a lever, identify which type and also make a list of other levers which we see in our homes.

How does the observation also explain Newton‚Äôs Third Law? ( action/ reaction)

What would happen if the candle is not balanced at its center?

What would be observed if the distance between the two glasses is increased?

Is it possible that the seesaw performs a full rotation? (that sure would look amazing)

Children should record the observations in their science journal. Indeed an illuminating activity!

Vibrant Traces

Materials required

1. White paper towels/tissue paper /filter paper

2. Gel/ink pens of different colours

3. Transparent galsses

4. Scissors

5. Cellotape

Activity

Cut thin strips of paper towel with scissors.

Use a sketch pen to draw a horizontal line on the strip measuring about 1-1.5 cm from the bottom of the strip and affix it to the pen with cello tape.

Dip the strip in a glass containing water such that only the edge of the paper touches the water.

Chromatography is a technique to separate mixtures and has an impact on our everyday life. It can be used to check impurities in our food, water and medicines. This is widely deployed by police & forensic scientists to identify substances found at crime scenes. The procedure can be easily understood with the help of paper chromatography.

After a few minutes when the water crosses the horizontal line you would notice that different pigments of the ink have separated. Remove the strip.

As the solvent (water in this case) moves up the paper, it takes the mixture with it. Based on their affinity to solvent, you would notice that different components of the mixture will move at different rates i.e. are they hydrophobic (water-hating) or hydrophilic (water-loving). The upward movement of water through the paper is attributed to capillary action. Water being a sticky liquid, we are dealing with the forces of adhesion (water sticks to the paper) and cohesion (water sticks to itself).

Exploration-Test the inks in different solvents ‚Äì nail paint remover, surgical spirit, vinegar, cooking oil, turpentine oil.

Marigold petals, rose petals, beetroot, spinach cut into small pieces (use whatever is available), immerse the samples individually in rubbing alcohol (surgical spirit). After about 30-40 minutes, filter and test the pigments contained in each with the help of strips of paper towels/ tissue paper.

For a given solvent test use different type of papers ‚Äì newspaper, paper from notebook.

Record & tabulate your observation in a Science journal.

This experiment is to be used in a role play (as a detective) for mock forensic investigation.

Such experiences are key enablers to help our children form their own ideas- not necessary conforming to the established scientific explanations.

Creativity is at the core of science, because science presents obstacles in discovery, and creativity allows for us to devise ways around those obstacles. Science has always tested human‚Äôs ability to think outside the box and question their surroundings, and creativity has been the driving force

May your creativity thrive and blossom! For you and the global good!

(Source: Getty Images) It is extremely crucial that we take time and reflect on what truly matters to each one of us. (Source: Getty Images)

‚ÄúWhat if we all go back to normal and nothing changes? What if all this is for nothing?‚Äù That‚Äôs why we need our very own Zihuatanejo, an icon of hope that our world will never be the same again.

‚ÄúWhat is your Zihuatanejo?‚Äù If you have seen the uplifting movie Shawshank Redemption, then you might have an idea of what I am talking about. For the others, without any spoilers, let me give you a little preview. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is a successful banker, falsely convicted to a life sentence in Shawshank prison for his wife‚Äôs and her lover‚Äôs murders. There, he makes many friends and quietly brings about humane changes for the inmates in his own gentle way. One scene that stands out in my memory is when, after 20 years of imprisonment, he shares the idea of ‚ÄòZihuatanejo‚Äô with his friend Red (Morgan Freeman). He talks about how he dreams of going to Zihuatanejo one day. Describing the place, he says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs in Mexico, some place in the Pacific Ocean. You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific? They say it has no memory. That‚Äôs where I want to live for the rest of my life ‚Äì a warm place with no memory.‚Äù Red is initially enchanted by this idea but then dismisses it as ‚Äúsilly pipe dreams‚Äù and himself as an ‚Äúinstitutional man‚Äù who has no life outside the prison.

Shawshank Redemption continues to be one of my favourite movies and Zihuatanejo one of the most powerful and uplifting metaphors. And so relevant for our COVID lockdown times where it is so easy for us to lose hope and get locked in with a sense of despair with, ‚ÄúWhat if things never become better?‚Äù Then there is another very real fear I hear from young people, ‚ÄúWhat if we all go back to normal and nothing changes? What if all this is for nothing?‚Äù That‚Äôs why we need our very own Zihuatanejo, an icon of hope that our world will never be the same again. Keeping the overwhelming tragedy aside, maybe COVID might help us to dream of a brave new world ‚Äì our very own Zihuatanejo where we can let go of the memory of our stale old world which had literally started rotting and stinking.

But it is not easy to imagine this Zihuatanejo. We have been institutionalised so much by a culture that applauds hustle, busyness, hoarding, competing, that we have no way of knowing any other way. The lockdown has forced us to step back but we really have no idea what this world would look like. We are so locked in our prison of thoughts, habits, and toxic patterns of life that it is difficult to think of any other way. Therefore it becomes extremely crucial that we take time and reflect on what truly matters to each one of us. What changes do we want to bring? What is our vision, what is our Zihuatanejo?

Please find a quiet space in your house and reflect on these questions. It would be even more effective if you write these down in a notebook.

What is the society‚Äôs idea of success?

Is it in keeping with what you value most? If you had to redefine the idea of success then what would it look like? For example if you realised during the lockdown that you want to slow down and spend more time with your family then what steps would you need to take for that? Alternatively, if you decided that you would no longer give away a large part of your income in promoting multibillion dollar industries that choke up our environment then where would you spend it instead? Talking about money, how central would money be in all the decisions you make about your life?

What is this lockdown made you feel strongly about any issue of social justice?

Would you be able to take a stand for it? As things start stumbling back to ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again ‚Äì what initiatives would you like to take? Give a certain number of hours in the day to an NGO, sponsoring a child‚Äôs education, starting an awareness drive on LGBTQ on social media. It could be anything that stirs your soul, enriches your life by what you get by giving back. As Ian Anderson from the band Jethro Tull put, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs only the giving that makes you, what you are.‚Äù

It does not have to be a momentous transformative change, it could be something very small. A 13-year-told me, ‚ÄúI have decided that after this whole thing is over I will be kinder and more respectful towards people who work for us.‚Äù That was her Zihuatanejo. She went one step ahead and formed a WhatsApp group with her friends in the society to start a fund-raising for the domestic staff. Another set of brothers (both below the age of 16) raised over 7 lakhs of rupees for an NGO that supports daily wage workers during lockdown. These children are showing us the way for a braver new world.

Imagine your older wiser self, who is living their life aligned to what you value the most.

Where are they living, what are they doing for their living? Which relationships and communities do they hold close to their heart? What advice would they give you on how you can navigate this part of your life?

These questions might help us connect to our Zihuatanejo ‚Äì what we value the most and what keeps us going through the darkest times. We need to remember that our values are not our destination but give us a direction. And we need to start today and not wait for the lockdown to get over. Let‚Äôs commit to taking as little 30 minutes every day to start mapping our adventure to find our very own Zihuatanejo. It does not have to fit into what society deems as successful or worthy but what connects to our vision for our life. We have to strive to do it now and not wait for things to become ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. Because the longer we wait to begin, the less likely we are to find it at all. As Andy in Shawshank Redemption put it, ‚ÄúI guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying.‚Äù

By Dr Sandeep Chaddha

No doubt, pregnancy is the most beautiful phase in a woman‚Äôs life. During this phase, women tend to experience immunological and physiological changes that often make them worry about theirs and the unborn child‚Äôs health. And, when the world is fighting the deadly coronavirus pandemic, the anxiety and stress levels increase in expecting mothers.

The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China in January, has rapidly spread across the globe, including to every state in India. With so many people getting affected by it irrespective of age and gender, It‚Äôs only natural to have questions about coronavirus and what it means for one‚Äôs pregnancy. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.

What is coronavirus?

Coronaviruses are a multiplying family of viruses, which lead to illness ranging from the common cold to severe diseases like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). The coronavirus was only recently found to infect humans and scientists are still trying to learn about it. On March 11, WHO said COVID-19 is officially a global pandemic as over three lakh people across the globe have been tested positive.

How is this virus transmitted and what are the symptoms?

According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Coronaviruses typically spread from an infected person to other people via respiratory drops that get into the air by coughing or sneezing, Close contact with an infected person, like touching or shaking hands, or touching a surface that has been contaminated with the virus and then touching your mouth, nose or eyes before you wash your hands can also spread the virus.

Symptoms include:

Fever, cough and breathing difficulties.

In more severe cases, one may also get pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death.

What precautions should pregnant women should take?

Since pregnant women are immunocompromised, they are more susceptible to complications of respiratory infections, flu and if not treated immediately, it can impact their health severely.

Not only this, but pregnant women may also suffer from severe illness, morbidity and mortality compared to others. They have chances of getting other related coronavirus infections, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)) and other viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, during pregnancy.

A small study of nine pregnant women in Wuhan, China, with confirmed COVID-19 found no evidence of the virus in their breast milk, cord blood, amniotic fluid.

Though there is no evidence that suggests that pregnant women are at the risk of miscarriage or even of the virus passing to the developing baby while the mother is pregnant, the research is still going on.

How they can protect themselves from coronavirus?

Pregnant women should take precautions in order to keep coronavirus away. Similar to other members, they should also wash their hands at regular intervals, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands, avoid close contact, cover your mouth while coughing and sneezing or wear a face mask and clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.

If you are pregnant and feel sick, then consult your doctor immediately as your baby may also be vulnerable to coronavirus.

Roles maternity hospitals should play

As the virus has continued its spread across India, many hospitals and birthing centres have been enacting new measures to keep mothers and babies safe. They should restrict visitors and only closed ones can enter the delivery room. If a patient has been exposed to or tests positive for COVID-19, they should be shifted to a separate and isolated ward with doctors and nurses wearing protective gear.

Experts recommend breastfeeding the baby for at least the first six months after birth. Breast milk is beneficial for the baby as it provides all essential nutrients and boosts his or her immunity. But at the time of social distancing to avoid transmission of coronavirus, is it safe for the mother to breastfeed the baby?

Whether the mother is suspected to have or tested positive with COVID-19, she should be encouraged to breastfeed in both cases, Ruth Patterson, chief lactation consultant, Cloudnine Group of Hospitals, Bengaluru, told Express Parenting. ‚ÄúTill now, there is no evidence that breastmilk can transmit the virus. The mother, however, has to be counselled well on her hygiene,‚Äù she said.

How to feed the baby if you show symptoms

Before feeding the baby, the mother should wash her hands well with soap and water or an alcohol-based sanitiser. While feeding, the mother should wear a face mask as a protective measure so that there is no transmission via respiratory droplets. Make sure the face mask fits well around the face and covers the mouth and face completely. One should also maintain a safe distance between their face and the baby while feeding, advised Patterson.

‚ÄúIf the mother is showing severe symptoms and needs medical attention, she could be advised to express the milk and give it to the caretaker who should be able to feed the child. The caretaker should also follow sanitation practices before feeding. If the milk is not expressed, it will accumulate and cause more trouble to the mother. Apart from handwashing and cleaning the breasts, the pump should be disinfected before use. The mother should wash her hands before and after collecting milk,‚Äù the lactation consultant added.

She further advised that the mother and the baby‚Äôs surroundings should be thoroughly cleaned at intervals, with soap and water. The baby should be touched with utmost precaution. If the mother is COVID-19 positive, she can wear a gown and feed and can take it off after feeding, besides taking the regular sanitary measures. It is further recommended that you speak to a lactation consultant to take necessary measures, now that doctors are providing teleconsultation services to patients.

Shakib Al Hasan became the only cricketer to score 600 plus runs and scalp 10 wickets in a single edition of the World Cup in 2019.

Star Bangladesh all-rounder Shakib Al Hasan has decided to auction the bat he used during the 2019 ODI World Cup to help raise money for the fight against deadly coronavirus pandemic.

Shakib, who is currently serving a two-year ban from all forms of cricket ‚Äî one of which is suspended ‚Äî for not reporting corrupt approaches, is the second Bangladeshi cricketer after wicket-keeper batsman Mushfiqur Rahim to auction a personal cricketing gear to raise money for the cause. ‚ÄúI had said before that I want to put up a bat for auction. I have decided to auction the bat I used in the 2019 World Cup. It‚Äôs a favourite bat of mine,‚Äù Shakib said during a Facebook live session.

The 33-year-old all-rounder had a hugely successful World Cup in England last year, scoring 606 runs in eight matches at an average of 86.57, which included two centuries and five fifties. Besides, he also picked up 11 wickets in the tournament and became the only cricketer to score 600 plus runs and scalp 10 wickets in a single edition of the World Cup.

‚ÄúI had a good World cup with the bat and ball. There were some good performances, especially with the bat. I had used a single bat throughout the World Cup and even used tapes on it to get through games,‚Äù Shakib said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that this bat has only been used at the World Cup. I have scored over 1500 runs with this bat and had used it prior to the tournament and after it as well.

‚ÄúAlthough I like the bat a lot but I have decided to put it up for auction with the thought that maybe it can leave some contribution to forming a fund during the ongoing coronavirus crisis.‚Äù The money raised from the auction will go to the Shakib Al Hasan foundation. ‚ÄúThis is a very special bat to me, but my people are even more special to me,‚Äù Shakib said.

Coronavirus (COVID-19): Kerala has bucked the national trend for novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) with a doubling time of 72.2 days ‚Äî which means that the number of cases in the state doubled in that many days ‚Äî against a national average of 7.5 days. Last week, the Centre showcased the contact tracing and containment model of Kerala‚Äôs Kasaragod, one of the earliest spots on India‚Äôs COVID-19 map, as one of the success stories of the containment exercise.

A look at the Kasaragod model, and how it differs from some of the other models across the country that have generated interest.

Coronavirus: Why showcase Kasaragod?

Kasaragod reported the third case of COVID-19 in the country ‚Äî a student airlifted from Wuhan on February 3. The district administration mounted a massive exercise to trace the 150-odd contacts of that one student.

Read| Fight against COVID-19: Behind Kerala‚Äôs flattening curve, involvement of community

According to figures uploaded by the Kerala government, Kasaragod has had 169 cases and zero deaths until April 19, a unique achievement in itself, given the fact that a large proportion of the district‚Äôs population have settled abroad. Of those infected, 123 people have recovered so far, leaving only 46 active cases among the original 169.

Data source: Government of Kerala

In the initial days of the epidemic, almost all index cases were people who had caught the virus during their travels abroad (about 15.38%). The second wave in the district happened after people started coming back from the Middle East from March 16.

Kasaragod: Under what circumstances was this containment achieved?

The district is far from major cities, so that the isolation exercise was smoother. Kasaragod is Kerala‚Äôs northernmost district, far away from capital Thiruvananthapuram. However, this distance also presented an additional challenge. When expatriates returned in large groups, they landed in various airports and took various public transport options ‚Äî railways, road etc ‚Äî to reach home, which had the potential to leave contacts all along the way.

Health Ministry officials said that while Kasaragod has been showcased, the success of Kerala as a whole is a story essentially of the strength of the state‚Äôs healthcare system rather than one of the immediate measures taken. ‚ÄúIt is not for nothing that it leads in all human development indices. The most amazing thing about Kerala is how receptive they are of suggestions for improvement,‚Äù said a senior official in the Health Ministry.

What is the Kasaragod model?

The district administration relied on aggressive testing, technology, foolproof contact tracing, and an effective public awareness campaign on social distancing to achieve the results it can now show. In Kasaragod, as in other districts, the state government appointed a special officer to coordinate functioning of the district administration and for effective coordination between line departments at field and secretariat levels. Section 144 was imposed in the entire district, with seven drones employed for surveillance. Under the Care for Kasaragod initiative, a detailed action plan ‚Äî common coordinated action plan ‚Äî was drawn up for combating COVID-19 so that all stakeholders could turn to it when the situation arose.

And what was this action plan?

All quarantined people were tracked using GPS. All essentials were home-delivered in the containment/cluster zones, irrespective of whether they were rich or poor. A campaign on social distancing called ‚ÄúBreak the Chain‚Äù was carried out to deliver the message of social distancing. Core teams were formed with incident commanders to rush to various areas and take quick action.

The plan was carried out with a very strong social welfare component, which included free food kits for the poor and migrant workers, a strong check on hoarding and black-marketing, and health checkup on alternate days for migrants or the destitute. Community kitchens supplied free food. Jana Jagratha Samitis at the ward level ensured that the messaging reached every person.

What was the scale of the exercise?

A total of 17,373 people were quarantined. On an average, 100-150 samples were tested every day and new testing labs were started. The medical college in Kasaragod with 200 beds and an ICU facility was operationalised in four days. There is also a 709-bed COVID-19 care centre. ASHAs and health inspectors carried out household surveys.

All primary and secondary contacts of high-risk cases (those aged 60 or above) were quarantined in isolation centres. This was done as many homes did not have separate toilets.

What are the other successful models containment?

In a recent meeting, the Centre asked district magistrates to draw up separate crisis plans for COVID-19 management, and shared several models. These include Agra, Bhilwara, Pathanamthitta etc.

AGRA MODEL: Under the cluster containment and outbreak containment plan in Agra, the district administration identified epicentres, delineated the impact of positive confirmed cases on the map, and deployed a special task force as per a micro plan made by the district administration. The hotspots were managed through an active survey and containment plan. The ‚Äúhotspot‚Äù area was identified within a radius of 3 km from the epicentre, while a 5 km buffer zone was identified as the containment zone.

BHILWARA MODEL: This entailed complete isolation of Bhilwara city with Section 144 CrPC being imposed. In the first phase, essential services were allowed; in the second phase, the shutdown was total with the city and district borders sealed and checkposts at every entry and exit point. Trains, buses and cars were stopped. The district magistrates of neighbouring districts too were asked to seal their borders. The message from Bhilwara was ‚Äúruthless containment‚Äù.

PATHANAMTHITTA MODEL: Kerala deployed technology to a large extent in the Pathanamthitta model too. Every person who had entered the district was screened and a database created so that they could be reached at short notice. Graphics were created showing the travel route of the positive cases and publicised. This led to self-reporting. As people realised from the route maps and the travel times that they had come in contact with someone positive for COVID-19, many walked up to be screened or treated.

https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/what-is-the-sprinklr-row-kerala-govts-covid-19-response-6371205/,"LDF government has been accused of allowing the US-based tech firm Sprinklr to collate and handle the health data of 1.75 lakh people under quarantine without taking their individual consent. LDF government has been accused of allowing the US-based tech firm Sprinklr to collate and handle the health data of 1.75 lakh people under quarantine without taking their individual consent.

Even as it earns praise within India and outside for its deft handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the ‚Äòflattening‚Äô of the infection curve, the Kerala government is in the dock for allegedly breaching privacy of 1.75 lakh people under quarantine in the state by striking a deal with a US-based tech firm to handle the data compiled from them.

Kerala: What is the Sprinklr controversy?

Earlier this month, Leader of the Opposition Ramesh Chennithala, at a press conference in the state capital, mounted an offensive against the ruling LDF government accusing it of allowing the US-based tech firm Sprinklr to collate and handle the health data of 1.75 lakh people under quarantine without taking their individual consent. The data, including details of their symptoms and underlying health conditions, was compiled by workers at the grassroot level using a tool developed by Sprinklr with the aim of assisting doctors and medical officials in making an informed choice about possible hospitalisation.

The Congress-led Opposition charged that the government did not follow due procedures in appointing Sprinklr and thereby risked the transfer of crucial health data of thousands of people to pharmaceutical companies. It questioned why the administration took the assistance of a foreign firm when there were institutions like Centre for Development of Imaging technology (CDIT) and Kerala State IT Mission that can do the same job. Chennithala said the decision to appoint Sprinklr, owned by a Keralite named Ragy Thomas, was taken unilaterally with the knowledge of the chief minister without obtaining clearances from departments like law, local self-government and finance.

How did the LDF government respond?

The state government defended the move by stating that the company‚Äôs tool was offered free-of-cost as a software-as-a-service (SaaS) and that the firm was owned by a Keralite. The IT department said the data was being collected on a massive scale and therefore needed the intervention of an application which can collate it in a quick way and help analyse it. Sprinklr‚Äôs SaaS tool was already ready and therefore had to be just customised to meet the state‚Äôs needs.

The government, in a bid to reaffirm its transparency, also released documents in connection with the contract it signed with Sprinklr on April 2. Documents include the purchase order form, service agreement, privacy policy of the company and a non-disclosure agreement. The documents state that the data belong to the Kerala government.

Additionally, the agreement order signed with the company stated, ‚ÄúEvery employee participates in mandatory data protection and information security trainings and is formally obliged to data secrecy. Sprinklr established a data protection steering committee of key functional leaders throughout the company and Sprinklr also appointed an experienced Data Protection Officer.‚Äù

Following the allegations, the government changed the domain name for the entry of data from citizencenter.sprinklr.com to citizencenter.kerala.gov.in.

Is there truth in the allegations?

From the looks of the non-disclosure and service agreements signed with the company, it certainly appears that the ownership of the health data remains with the Kerala government, even though it may have been temporarily hosted on servers owned by Sprinklr. There is no exchange of financial favours in the arrangement.

But questions still remain how and why Sprinklr was singularly appointed for the task without even putting out a global tender. Since the exercise involves confidential data of thousands of people, it begs to ask the question why the government did not feel the need to make the deal public.

What is the political relevance of the controversy?

The Opposition Congress-led UDF, perturbed at the praise the CPM-led government has been receiving for its handling of the pandemic, has sensed an opening in the battle ranks with which it can target the chief minister. Since the IT department, which signed the deal with Sprinklr, is held by the chief minister, the Opposition believes the buck stops with him. With Assembly elections just a year away, the Opposition believes the row can help it politically to target the ruling coalition.

The nature of the row is also particularly troubling for the CPM as it had aggressively taken on the BJP-led Centre over data privacy concerns surrounding the national Aadhaar project.

Coronavirus (COVID-19): A grassroots network of local bodies and women‚Äôs self-help groups in Kerala has made the state‚Äôs fight against COVID-19 a community initiative-a game-changer that is helping it flatten the curve.

With thousands of people put under home quarantine, their non-medical needs requiring looking after, and several hotspots sealed, the local bodies were called in for effective micro-level implementation of the containment strategy.

As surveillance of those under observation became necessary with increasing numbers-at one point it touched 1.71 lakh in Kerala-ward/division level committees were formed under all local self-governing bodies.

The ground reporting by these committees helped the Health Department ensure that those with a travel history even outside their native district remained in isolation. Their vigil also helped guarantee that the state‚Äôs mandated quaratine period of 28 days-higher than that of other states-was followed by those under observation.

The state‚Äôs women empowerment programme, Kudumbashree, stepped in with massive production of personal care products, which faced a spike in demand from health workers and the general public. Over the last month, the neighbourhood self-help groups under the mission churned out 19.42 lakh reuseable masks and 4,700 liters of handrubs, mainly for the health department. The women under this programme are also taking care of the needs the 4,500-odd elderly persons who are under observation.

A Kudumbashree official said the programme has 1.9 lakh Whatsapp groups with 22.5 lakh members. During the pandemic, these groups were used to broadcast precautionary messages. ‚ÄúAfter lockdown, we could start 1200-odd community kitchens across Kerala within three days of the the government issuing direction. We have a three-tier communication system, to take directives quickly downstream the organisation and execute an action plan,‚Äù said the mission official.

The mission is now expanding its participation in the COVID fight. Last week, it began manufacturing face shields for health workers.

According to State Planning Board Member Dr B Ekbal, the involvement of local self-governments and Kudumbashree mission has taken the state‚Äôs fight against COVID-19 to community level.

‚ÄúOur local bodies have the capacity to handle any emergency and women in the Kudumbashree were prompt to respond. We are now harvesting the fruits of our decentralization of power to local bodies,‚Äù he said.

Ekbal, also the chairman of an expert committee advising the government on the virus, was referring to Kerala‚Äôs decentralization of power in 1995, when the management of government hospitals-primary to district-went into the hands of three-tier local bodies. Accordingly, a village panchayat was given a major stake in the management of a primary or family health centre. Over the years, several local bodies invested in improving hospital infrastructure and increasing the number of supporting health workers.

Dr Joy Elamon, director-general of Kerala Institute of Local Administration (KILA), said the proactive role of the local bodies and neighbourhood groups under Kudumbashree are unique to the state‚Äôs COVID-19 control measures.

Of around 1,200 local bodies in Kerala, about half of them have prepared the draft of their disaster management action plan. ‚ÄúWhen these bodies were called to respond to COVID-19, the data on spread of aged population and vulnerable sections could be gathered easily due to this draft disaster management plan. Even such panchayats have details about locations where people can be relocated and who require assistance at time of crisis,‚Äù he said.

In compliance with the Indian Medical Association‚Äôs (IMA) appeal to register a protest and vigil for the lives of the medical staff lost on the frontline against the COVID-19, IMA Chandigarh also appealed to the local medical staff and hospitals to commemorate a ‚Äòwhite alert‚Äô in the city on Wednesday at 9 pm, by lighting candles outside hospitals and private residences for the vigil.

The appeal for the protest and vigil was especially triggered by an incident in Chennai, in which a mob hindered the burial of a 55-year-old neurosurgeon who died due to COVID-19. At the cemetery, where the doctor was to be a buried, a mob pelted stones and attacked the ambulance which contained the neuro-surgeon‚Äôs body. The doctor‚Äôs colleague was later compelled to dig a grave with his own hands to bury him.

‚ÄúThis is the limit. It is so disheartening to see how the country is treating those who are putting their life on the line everyday to serve the nation. There needs to be a special law in place. Such inhumane acts should have repercussions,‚Äù says Dr Rajesh Dhir, president of IMA Chandigarh.

‚ÄúWHEN I joined Delhi police services, I had a different impression about the police service. It was of chasing the tough criminals, solving sensational crimes and maintaining law and order situation in the area. But the COVID-19 pandemic duty has changed my perspective about policing completely. I am learning a lot these days. It is one of the experiences which will help me throughout my professional career,‚Äù says under-training DSP Palak Goel, SHO PS Maloya. A 2019 batch DANIPS cadre DSP joined Chandigarh police in January this year on the probation period, she is under practical training in the city.

‚ÄúThough a 12-hour long duty has made it mandatory for every police personnel these days, but being the SHO of Maloya, my duty is round-the-clock. Apart from maintaining law and order, attending all the crime spots in the area is my prior duty. Maloya is a densely-populated area full of rehabilitation colonies, slum colonies and villages and making people follow the complete lockdown and curfew rules is a big challenge in itself.‚Äù

The Maloya police station is one of the most sensitive area in terms of policing and areas including Dadumajra village, Maloya, Maloya colony, Gawala colony etc, containing more than one lakh, fall under the jurisdiction of the station.

Palak Goel‚Äôs spans from ensuring social distancing on part of people standing in long queues for collecting dry ration, food packets to maintaining law and order, and also keeping a tab on the movements at outer nakas which are under her jurisdiction.

The officer follows all precautions before entering and leaving her house. ‚ÄúI enter the house from the rear gate, sanitize the uniform, belt, badges, stars, shoes and my cell phone. I take a wash and enter the main premises of the house. My husband follows the same routine,‚Äù she said.

DSP Palak Goel lives in Sector 7 Panchkula and her husband, Deepanker Garg, is an under-training Punjab Civil Service (PCS) officer, posted in Mohali. He is also engaged in COVID-19 duties these days.

Three more deaths due to the novel coronavirus were reported in the state, taking the toll to 15, Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha said on Tuesday.

With 29 more positive cases, the number of active cases rose from 245 to 274, said the official. However, according to data on the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare website, 392 people in the state have contracted the disease till date, and 73 have been discharged from hospitals after being cured, putting the number of active cases at 319.

At a press conference, Sinha said: ‚ÄúThe state government today focussed on hotspots in seven districts ‚ÄîKolkata, Howrah, Hooghly, North and South 24 Parganas, Nadia, and West Burdwan.‚Äù

The Chief Secretary told reporters that health officials started rapid testing from Tuesday, and collected 220 samples from different containment areas. ‚ÄúWe are expecting that the number will increase soon,‚Äù Sinha added. He pointed out that since Monday ‚Äúthe quantum of sample tested had jumped to 713 and cumulative total sample tested went up to 6,182‚Äù.

From Wednesday, the number of samples tested is expected to increase since one laboratory each at Chittaranjan National Cancer Institute (CNCI) in Rajarhat, and RG Kar Medical College and Hospital would also start examining specimens.

The Chief Secretary said many students from the state were stuck in the city of Kota in Rajasthan, but added it was not possible to bring them back at the moment.

‚ÄúThe guardians are repeatedly asking us to get back those students,‚Äù Sinha told reporters. ‚ÄúWe think this is not desirable in this situation. I will talk to the Chief Secretary of Rajasthan, and also our nodal officer PB Salim will talk to their nodal officer Shreya Guha. The logistic support needed to get them back is not possible in this situation. We have requested them to stay there some more days.‚Äù

The Chief Secretary said the government was doing everything possible to maintain the lockdown. ‚ÄúWe are monitoring the situation round the clock,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúWe booked 28,000 people for violating the lockdown. We also seized 3,000 vehicles, and filed cases against 3,100 people.‚Äù

At the moment, 5,016 people are in government quarantine, and 33,205 people are in home quarantine, according to the government.

Meanwhile, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee visited some containment areas here such as Rajarhat, Park Circus, and Metiabruz, and urged people to maintain the lockdown.

Twelve-hour long duty, training doctors, nurses, housekeeping staff, examining COVID-19 patients and counselling their relatives, concern that she might carry infection to her home where her 87-year-old mother-in-law lives, switching off from friends, sleepless nights and calls to psychiatrists for help ‚Äì this has been new normal for Dr Arti Trivedi, an additional professor with PDU Medical College in Rajkot who is leading the team treating coronavirus-infected patients at the Rajkot Civil Hospital for the past one month.

The scramble began on March 1 when the state government asked the medical college and hospital to prepare for the pandemic. Preparations included planning, setting up a dedicated isolation ward, as well as training staff, Trivedi says.

Eventually, what was apprehended turned into reality ‚Äì a 32-year-old businessman who returned to the city from abroad tested positive for COVID-19 on March 18, the first confirmed case in Gujarat. Within a week, the number of cases rose to nine.

‚ÄúEverything was so fast and intense in initial days that I would lose sense of time. I would reach hospital at 8 am, examine patients in the OPD and assess patients in isolation ward. Besides attending official meetings, I have to look after my team, ensure that they have enough supplies and that they take all precautions. Often, I would return home at 10 pm. I started having sleepless nights. I had to consult colleagues in psychiatry department,‚Äù says Trivedi, the leading physician of the hospital.

Besides treating patients and guiding the team of around 100 members, including three dozen doctors, Trivedi has to care for her mother-in-law who has diabetes and hypertension. Her husband is also a physician doing private practice. Her elder daughter is a physiotherapist while the younger one is studying neuroscience.

Despite all precautions, a doctor is never fully insulated from the risk of contracting the infection, Trivedi says. She says a doctor may not be wearing a PPE all the time but exposure can happen anytime.

Trivedi recalls an incident while dealing with a 76-year-old woman on March 24. ‚ÄúAfter her reports came positive, I went to her husband and son who were waiting outside. As soon I broke the news, her son collapsed. What does one do? One instinctively helps the person to get back on his feet even though he was having temperature and other symptoms and I was not wearing a PPE,‚Äù she says.

The next day, the woman‚Äôs son also tested positive. However, Trivedi, who herself is 57, has gone about her job without any break and hasn‚Äôt felt the need to get herself tested for the infection.

‚ÄúThings have been so fast that I don‚Äôt even get time to think about myself. Cooking is the only thing that makes me feel human. Rest of the time, I am like a robot,‚Äù says the mother of two.

And how does she keep herself, and her team, motivated even though no proven cure is available for coronavirus and patients are given symptomatic treatment?

‚ÄúWe try to look for clues which tell us if the patient is improving or worsening. If we are able to pick up a worsening patient in time, probably we might be able to do something. Actually, there is nothing on hand which is proven. But if we are able to at least pick up a newly-developing complication, maybe we can take some action on time and save some lives,‚Äù says the doctor who has been practising medicine for 28 years.

Does she fear contracting the infection herself? ‚ÄúThe fear is as real in me is it is in you. But then, this is my chosen profession. Besides, the outbreak is also an opportunity to try and do something to save lives,‚Äù she says.

‚ÄúMy team members are warriors. I am doing what ought to be done. My team ‚Äì the young doctors, nurses, those keeping the ward clean and sanitised ‚Äì are risking their lives. They are heroes,‚Äù the professor adds as her voice becomes heavy.

Coronavirus (COVID-19): Two migrant workers who were on their way home were run over by a goods train in Chhattisgarh‚Äôs Koriya district on Tuesday morning.

Kamleshwar Rajwade (21) and Gulab Rajwade (20) were residents of Ucchadih and Nevra villages of Surajpur district and were undergoing training for compost production at the Pendra Krishi Kendra. Stuck in Gaurela-Marwahi-Pendra district and their work stopped because of the lockdown, the duo left along with two others for their homes, nearly 130 km away in Surajpur district, on Monday night. They walked on railway tracks to avoid being stopped by the police.

After walking for 80 km, the four stopped to eat. ‚ÄúThey stopped between Udalkachar and Darritola in Koriya district when a freight train ran over them. They couldn‚Äôt understand that the train was coming as there was a curve on the tracks‚Ä¶ Their colleagues were saved as they had gone to look for water,‚Äù said a police officer.

Bhupesh Baghel writes to PM Modi, seeks Rs 30,000 crore aid

Raipur: Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has written a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi requesting financial assistance of Rs 30,000 crore from the Centre over the next three months with an immediate release of Rs 10,000 crore. He also requested that exemptions from the lockdown be extended in green districts for sweet shops, vehicle and electronic showrooms, repair works, sale of properties and all retail activities, to help the state gain revenue.

‚ÄúDue to the long period of lockdown, revenue collections have come down to almost zero‚Ä¶ there is also a big reduction in the amount that the state receives from central taxes‚Ä¶ the state government is needing additional resources for the livelihood of the 56 lakh poor and needy families,‚Äù he wrote while also referring to financial assistance for industry, business, service and agriculture sectors. ‚ÄîENS

Coronavirus (COVID-19): In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Punjab CM Captain Amarinder Singh suggested a three-pronged strategy to bail out the states from the COVID-19 crisis, including a three-month special financial package and extension to the 15th Finance Commission till October 2021 for submission of its final report.

He requested the PM to ask the 15th Finance Commission to review its interim report for 2020-21 in context of the much lower revenue share for the states as compared to earlier projections which assumed 7 per cent GDP growth.

Noting that a zero growth scenario in GDP for India was not unlikely, he said that some analysts were projecting even negative growth.

Amarinder Singh also sought the Centre‚Äôs permission to open liquor vends in the state. He wrote to Home Minister Amit Shah seeking a go-ahead, with the condition of social distancing.

Have the results of the first three weeks of lockdown been along the expected lines?

The effect of the first three weeks of lockdown is now clearly visible. India has succeeded in flattening the curve. If we look back, we started with a case doubling rate about every three days in mid-March when the government took several measures to contain the outbreak, including travel restrictions and campaigning for social distancing etc. The doubling rate of cases by the end of March slowed to every five days. Since the 5th/6th April, the effect of lockdown on flattening the outbreak curve has become consistently evident. The doubling time now is close to every 8 days, and there is more to come. We can expect it to drop to every 10 days in the next few days. Because the lockdown continues up to 3rd May, we also expect further dampening of the curve well into mid-May. The trajectory after May would depend on the pace of lockdown de-escalation. Since opening of the lockdown will be a phased and nuanced affair, we should not expect an abrupt increase in cases. Thus, in terms of outbreak control, lockdown has yielded the desired results. Cases have remained limited and deaths have been low. Compare it with any other country and you would notice how well we have done as a nation.

How do you see this panning out? What will happen in the next two weeks and beyond?

In the next two weeks, I visualise consistent and deep adherence to lockdown norms. Areas where phased relaxations would kick in would also respect the limits of activities allowed. We presently have a limited number of hotspots and clusters, and the situation is under control. The next two weeks should see our effective containment of these hotspots just as it was achieved earlier in Agra, Bhilwara and in Kerala. It is also notable that large and highly populated states like Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have succeeded in ensuring that the outbreak remains well-contained. Containment efforts should go hand-in-hand with efforts to strengthen the health system. De-escalation of lockdown is potentially an opportunity for the virus to resurface and spread, and this is bound to happen to an extent. There could be new clusters when life and activities become more normal. The magnitude of such spread is inversely proportional to our collective compliance with the best practices. We cannot afford to fritter away the lockdown gains made at a phenomenal economic cost and hardship. We have to keep the virus transmission under check and ensure that no new peaks appear. June and July months will test our resolve.

Are we testing enough? Many experts seem to think we are missing the undercurrents of a much larger epidemic

India‚Äôs strategy of testing has been calibrated and pragmatic, making best use of the available resources. ICMR has scaled up our testing capability through a large laboratory network very rapidly, and engaged the private sector as well. Today, there are 201 government and 86 designated private laboratories in the country. In addition, 23 national science laboratory hubs are networked with 63 facilities in 16 cities for COVID-19 diagnostic services. There are some geographical areas that do need more access to testing systems. To address that, recently, all medical colleges have been requested to establish such laboratories. Our initial conservative testing guidelines were aligned to the then prevalent stage(s) of the disease. The guidelines have now been broadened, and we have tested as many as 3.6 lakh individuals so far. Even when our daily testing number has now reached 35,000, the proportion of those positive remains consistently around 4 per cent, indicating absence of any significant undercurrent of symptomatic cases. We will further refine and liberalise the testing strategy as the situation demands, and we will ensure adequate capacity to do so. Testing approach should be seen as a part and parcel of the overall strategy of pandemic control, and not in isolation.

What is the ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù after lockdown?

Life as we know has changed for now and the immediate future. The pandemic would be considered extinguished only when it subsides worldwide. Meanwhile, social distancing, wearing a mask and hand washing are the new normal. Protecting our elderly is the new normal. Likewise, the new normal would dictate us to avoid gatherings. We should get used to less crowded markets and shops. Virtual meetings will be the way forward in place of face to face meetings. We must be responsible enough to self-quarantine ourselves in case of flu-like symptoms. We must not attach stigma to a person who wants to be tested for COVID-19 or has been advised hospitalisation being positive.

In the rural areas, health facilities are fewer and far between. How will tracking and tracing happen there once lockdown is over ?

By and large, the rural areas have been free of the disease so far. The outbreak is largely urban and peri-urban. However, this cannot be taken for granted. Fortunately, the rural communities are taking proactive measures. These include wearing masks, washing hands, maintaining social distance and conforming to containment norms. There is no doubt that awareness about disease-prevention and life-saving practices in the rural heartland is huge. Access to healthcare and referral linkages are being strengthened. Participation of self-help groups and Panchayati Raj Institutions in this regard is laudable.

Is it true that a lot of PPEs from China have failed tests?

One donated lot of PPEs from China had to be returned due to quality issues.

Give an Idea about how the health sector was prepared (in terms of beds availability, testing kits, PPEs) between January 8 when India‚Äôs first COVID meeting happened and March 22 when lockdown started in many areas

The lockdown has provided the country a precious time window to mount optimum health system preparation. It is expected that among symptomatic cases, 80% would have mild disease, about 20% moderate and about 5% severe disease. The country has developed a comprehensive plan to face the onslaught of COVID-19 outbreak of a large scale should that eventuality arise despite all efforts. The preparedness approach taken aims to be ready for a very large potential surge of new cases of COVID-19. Three types of COVID-specific facilities have been envisaged. At the most sophisticated level, there will be dedicated COVID hospitals for severe cases with intensive care facilities. Then there are dedicated COVID health centres meant for moderately sick and high-risk cases who require oxygen and supportive care, but no intensive care. At the third rung, COVID care centres provide isolation facilities for COVID cases with mild disease and for those suspect cases to be kept in isolation till their tests confirm or refute the disease. It is also important to highlight here that COVID care centres would actually not be located in hospital facilities, but in quarantine-like systems such as hostels, schools, stadia, even hotels etc. The rationale is to make sure that hospital beds are utilised for the moderate and severe cases, and importantly, also for patients with other illnesses. The battle against COVID-19 will be fought together with the private sector. Private sector has almost the same number of beds as the government facilities. In particular, their strength in critical care is better than that of the government sector. There is also an initiative to convert train coaches into mobile COVID facilities. The government is ensuring optimum supplies of oxygen, medicines, PPEs, N95 masks etc. The requirements for PPEs will be taken care of fully very soon with increased local production and large imports.

A lot of routine health activities have halted, TB reporting is down to a fraction. Are we going to pay a long term price of COVID too in terms of other health problems?

With intense focus on COVID-19, it is possible that other key activities have been diluted to an extent. However, this was unavoidable given the dire circumstances. It is important now that our preparations for COVID-19 are in advanced stages, we should focus also on our national programmes and priority health problems. In particular, immunisation, maternal and child health, nutrition and TB care should be intensified. We should be ready for the usual diarrhea, malaria and dengue rise in coming months. Our health and wellness centre activities should also gather momentum even as our vigil for COVID‚Äì19 would continue unabated even after phased de-escalation of the lockdown.

Where are we in terms of vaccine, drugs etc.?

An effective vaccine is our decisive and ultimate defence against COVID-19. At least four firms in India are collaborating with overseas partners for research and development for SARS-Cov-2 vaccines. Likewise, at least four of our national laboratories have identified potential vaccine candidates. A BCG vaccine trial is on the anvil. An empowered Task Force is making sure that all efforts are made to develop an indigenous vaccine in the near future. India will not miss any opportunity to be the global hub for vaccine development and manufacturing. ICMR has created a clinical research network and a registry to serve as a platform for trials on various therapeutic modalities. These include studying the use of convalescent plasma, plasma exchange and other drugs such as Redemsivir etc. when available. ICMR laboratories are also examining the potential of novel drug molecules for their effect on the virus. An effort is also being undertaken to evaluate the efficacy of Ayurveda formulations on COVID-19 disease prevention and treatment. Prime Minister‚Äôs clarion call to the scientific community to develop a vaccine and other science solutions for COVID-19 has galvanised the research teams, the industry and the research organisations of the country.

(Representational Image)

A DAY after the Centre pulled up the Punjab government for diluting the COVID-19 lockdown by opening bookshops and AC/cooler outlets, Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday sought permission from the Centre to open the liquor vends in the state at a time when it was suffering major financial loss. Amarinder has written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah seeking a go-ahead, with the condition of social distancing, as the state‚Äôs revenue had sharply dipped amid the COVID-19 crisis and a curfew that would continue till May 3. The issue was raised by a few Cabinet ministers at the Cabinet sub-committee meet on finances chaired by the CM through video-conferencing. Ministers are learnt to have discussed that while liquor was being sold in black clandestinely by several liquor retailers, the government was suffering losses on account of excise collection.

‚ÄúWe told the CM that we should open the vends. We should ensure social distancing. Those people who are addicted to liquor have somehow managed to purchase it. Do you think they had stocks that could last a month? Then why should the government suffer financial loss? We can always follow social distancing. Queues should be marked outside the vends and buyers should be made to follow rules,‚Äù a minister told The Indian Express. Punjab has suffered losses to the tune of Rs 5,000 crore during the lockdown period. Finance Minister Manpreet Singh Badal has said that during the current fiscal year, Punjab‚Äôs deficit would be to the tune of Rs 22,000 crore. Every month, the state‚Äôs estimates of excise duty turn out to be over Rs 550 crore on sale of liquor. But due to the lockdown, the vends have been shut. ‚ÄúOur distilleries are functioning. There is labour inside. They are manufacturing sanitisers. The sanitisers are being supplied through transport. Then why can‚Äôt liquor be supplied too?‚Äù asked a minister. The CM, in his letter to Shah, has sought for sale of liquor to be allowed in a phased manner to mop up VAT and excise revenue. ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Home, GoI, should allow the state to take a conscious decision to allow the sale of liquor in certain areas in a phased manner with strict social distancing and other measures to prevent COVID-19,‚Äù he said.

Capt seeks Rs 7,400-cr from Centre Pointing to an alarming resource gap between the state‚Äôs anticipated receipt and committed expenditure, the CM on Tuesday also sought interim compensation to the tune of Rs 3,000 crore for the month of April on account of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In his letter to Shah, he also asked for expediting the release of the state‚Äôs GST arrears of Rs 4400 crore for the last four months, to help the state overcome its resource constraint.

Amarinder said the Centre should compensate Punjab for its loss of revenue due to COVID-19. While the Rs 3,000 crore for April was an estimate, he said ‚Äúdetailed assessment of loss and requirement of funds for relief and rehabilitation will be submitted in due course‚Äù.

However, he stressed, ‚ÄúThe Government of India should provide interim assistance so that the fight against COVID-19 is not allowed to weaken in any way.‚Äù Punjab, Amarinder said, was facing a huge strain on state exchequer on account of the required health and relief measures that are being continuously scaled up, ‚Äúwith hardly any revenue receipts accruing to the state during these days due to near complete shutdown of trade, business and industry‚Äù. The state government had made a provision of revenue receipts of Rs 3360 crore for April in the State Budget 2020-21. These included: GST- Rs 1322 crore; VAT on petroleum products ‚Äì Rs 465 crore; state excise revenue ‚Äì Rs 521 crore, motor vehicle tax ‚Äì Rs 198 crore; electricity duty ‚Äì Rs 243 crore, stamp duty ‚Äì Rs 219 crore, and non-tax revenue ‚Äì Rs 392 crore.

However, Amarinder observed that these receipts are expected to decline sharply as most economic activities in the state remain closed on account of the lockdown. The receipts on account of SGST, IGST, VAT, excise, stamp duty and motor vehicle taxes are almost negligible and the reduced electricity consumption has resulted in a drop of 60 per cent of the expected revenue from electricity duty during April 2020, he said. In addition, said the chief minister, the GST compensation of approximately Rs 4,400 crore for the last four months ‚Äî from December, 2019 to March, 2020 ‚Äî was also pending for disbursement by the Union government. On the other hand, he pointed out that the committed expenditure of the state i.e., debt servicing, pensions, salaries, relief measures for COVID-19, health care and infrastructure etc., is budgeted at Rs 7,301 crore for the month of April 2020, resulting in a huge resource gap between the anticipated receipts and committed expenditure. This, he said, would help the state immensely in its efforts to scale up the relief and healthcare measures and meet some, if not all, of its committed liabilities and other day-to-day expenses. The chief minister assured the home minister of the state‚Äôs full and continued support in the efforts of the Centre to overcome the present crisis.

Seeks 3-month special financial package

In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Amarinder suggested a three-pronged strategy to bail out the states from the COVID-19 crisis, including a 3-month special financial package and extension to the 15th Finance Commission till October 2021 for submission of its final report.

He the PM to ask the 15th Finance Commission to review its interim report for 2020-21 in the context of the much lower revenue share for the states compared with what was expected from the earlier projections which assumed 7 per cent growth of GDP. Noting that a zero growth scenario in GDP for India was not unlikely, he said that some analysts were projecting even negative growth. Given the likelihood of very low growth, which was expected to cause the revenue shortfall to last for the whole year, the CM requested Modi to direct the 15th Finance Commission to defer the submission of its full report to October, 2021, when they will be better able to make a realistic assessment of the likely growth of the economy over the next five years.

‚ÄúNothing would be worse than getting committed to a five year revenue sharing projection based on unrealistically high growth projections,‚Äù he warned, suggesting that the Finance Commission could make another interim report for 2021-22. ‚ÄúWith the states continuing to shoulder their committed liabilities and facing new demands on relief, health infrastructure expenditure etc, it is only fair and just that the 15 Finance Commission should be requested to recommend a Special Covid-19 Revenue Grant for the year 2020-21,‚Äù Amarinder further said. In his letter, the Chief Minister sought an immediate 3-month special financial assistance package to enables states to handle the additional health related expenditure and basic relief expenditure, and suggested that the package should give the states maximum flexibility to design, implement and execute it in a manner that is customised to local problems and needs. The immediate 3-month package may be adjusted against the Special Covid-19 Revenue Grant, as proposed, he said.

State allows staff from private hospitals to be deputed in govt hospitals Punjab Chief Secretary Karan Avtar Singh on Tuesday directed the departments of health and family welfare and medical education and research to depute staff of any public and private authority or body in government hospitals and medical colleges.

(Representational) The government has also detailed the standard operating procedure for HICC that will be implemented immediately when an HCW tests positive for the virus. (Representational)

Considering the possibility of healthcare workers (HCWs) contracting the novel coronavirus, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has issued specific guidelines for all states and union territories.

The guidelines are applicable for COVID-19 healthcare facilities (public and private) that are already receiving or preparing to receive suspected or confirmed coronavirus patients as well as non-Covid healthcare facilities.

The government has suggested, ‚ÄúThe Hospital Infection Control Committee (HICC) shall be responsible for establishing a mechanism for reporting of development of symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 in HCWs. These include surveillance for fever/cough/breathing difficulty through either self-reporting or active and passive screening at the beginning of their shift. The committee will also monitor patients (who have been admitted for non-Covid illness) for development of unexplained fever/cough/breathing difficulty during their stay.‚Äù

The government has also detailed the standard operating procedure for HICC that will be implemented immediately when an HCW tests positive for the virus. ‚ÄúThe HICC shall immediately inform the local health authorities about the case, assess clinical status of the patient prior to referral to a designated Covid facility. The patient should be immediately isolated to another room. If the clinical condition permits, such patients should be masked and only a dedicated healthcare worker should attend this case. If the clinical status of the case permits, transfer such case to a COVID-19 isolation facility (dedicated health centre or dedicated hospital), informing the facility beforehand about the transfer, as per his/her clinical status, test results (if available), with information to local health authority,‚Äù the guidelines add.

The Union Health Minister has also asked the states and UTs to ensure that ‚Äúall health facilities (HCF) must have a staffing plan in place including a contingency plan for such an event to maintain continuity of operations. e.g. staff in HCF can be divided into groups to work on rotation basis every 14 days and a group of back up staff, which is pooled in case some high risk exposure/HCW with suspected COVID-19 infection is detected.‚Äù

Decision on further use of non-COVID facilities where a case has been reported

The likely scenarios could be socio-demographic reasons ‚Äì a) Hospital‚Äôs catchment area is a large cluster of COVID-19 b) Catchment area has a population which has a large number of vulnerable individuals having multiple co-morbid condition, poor nutritional status and/or having individuals not able to practice social distancing e.g. slum clusters. Based on the scope of the cluster and degree to which the hospital has been affected (HCW patients, and HCW contacts), degree of the risk to the patients visiting the hospital such as those with chronic diseases etc. the decision can be made based on a risk assessment to:

# If the hospital authorities are reasonably satisfied that the source case/s have been identified and isolated, all contacts have been traced and quarantined and adequate disinfection has been achieved, the hospital will continue to function.

# In addition to steps taken above, if the health facility still continues to report new hospital acquired COVID-19 cases in the following days, it would be advisable to temporarily close the defined section of the health facility where the maximum number of HAI is being reported. After thorough cleaning and disinfection it can be put to use again.

# Despite taking the above measures, if the primary source of infection could not be established and/or the hospital is still reporting large number of cases among patients and HCWs, a decision needs to be taken to convert the non-Covid health facility into a Covid health facility under intimation to the local health department. In such a scenario, all healthcare workers of the facility should be oriented in infection prevention and control practices and other protocols.

The state recorded four new cases in the last 24 hours, including two from Sonipat and one each from Faridabad and Fatehabad.

HARYANA‚ÄôS RECOVERY rate for COVID-19 patients has crossed 57.65 per cent against the national average of 17.48 per cent. The state‚Äôs death rate has also reduced to 0.79 per cent against the national average of 3.15 per cent, said Haryana Health Minister Anil Vij on Tuesday.

The state recorded four new cases in the last 24 hours, including two from Sonipat and one each from Faridabad and Fatehabad.

While the national average of doubling of cases is 7.5 days, in Haryana, the doubling rate of cases is 13.15 days, as on April 21.

Over the last two days, 43 active coronavirus patients in the state were declared to have recovered from the infection and were discharged from various hospitals.

According to the state government‚Äôs Tuesday evening health bulletin, the total number of COVID-19 cases reported in Haryana was 255, which included 14 Italian nationals who were admitted in Gurgaon‚Äôs Medanta Hospital and all of them recovered and were discharged.

Of the 255, two patients had died while 147 have recovered and discharged till date. That leaves Haryana with 106 active coronavirus patients, of whom 104 have been admitted in hospitals for less than 14 days while only two patients have been in hospitals for more than 14 days.

Till Tuesday evening, Haryana had already sent over 14,562 samples for testing. Vij said, ‚ÄúIn terms of sample testing also, Haryana has the rate of 548 tests per million of the population while the national average is 304 tests per million of the population.‚Äù

The health minister had already announced that the state government would be screening the entire 2.5 crore population of the state, for which over 19,663 teams of health department officials, workers and volunteers have been constituted.

The maximum number of active cases are in Nuh, followed by 21 in Faridabad, 16 in Panchkula and 11 each in Gurgaon and Palwal. There are seven active cases in Sonipat, while there are four in Ambala, two each in Kaithal and Kurukshetra and one each in Bhiwani, Hisar and Panipat. There are 10 districts in Haryana that have no COVID-19 cases till now.

‚ÄúThe credit for this high recovery rate of patients in Haryana goes to the state‚Äôs employees and workers who have been working relentlessly with utmost discipline. Be it police, municipal employees, health department or any other government department, everybody has got united in this fight against the pandemic. I salute all those who have been working on front foot for all these weeks,‚Äù Vij said.

The health minister added, ‚ÄúEqual credit goes to the people of Haryana too who have been fully following lockdown instructions. This has also helped us curtail the spread of coronavirus. But the fight has not got over yet. I hope that with the cooperation of people of our state, we shall definitely win this battle against coronavirus. I also wish speedy recovery to the remaining active patients who are under treatment in various hospitals of Haryana.‚Äù
