We are in the midst of a surreal global pandemic that none of us imagined we would be experiencing in our lifetime. Certainly, we will remember this as BC (Before Covid19) and AD (After Disaster).

Unprecedented in its scale, (magnitudes in severity and duration than anything we can remember), it has brought out the worst and the best in us.

It’s a time for us to reflect on what’s truly important and to recalibrate our priorities and indeed, our lives. Health care workers including physicians, nurses, pharmacists, first responders, including emergency medical technicians, ambulance drivers, policemen, firefighters and teachers are (and always were) true super-heroes. Grocers, bus drivers, mailmen, courier workers and those involved with other essential services are busier than ever, and we owe them salutations and our heartfelt gratitude for their unwavering dedication. Others, who are not on the front lines of this battle are under lock-down at home.

Travel has come to a grinding halt, meetings and even once in a lifetime events such as weddings, have been cancelled or postponed, all leading to some bonus time for many of us. The time to experience solitude and engage in reflection, to be with family, to reconnect with old friends and rekindle relationships.

Used wisely, this extra time can be a tremendous opportunity for connection, tuning inwards, personal growth and development. And that, in this time of consternation and chaos, is a precious gift.

We respectfully suggest the following actions and welcome additional suggestions from the reader:

1. Start your day by springing out of bed when you wake up. Sing in the shower. Sip your coffee or tea, enjoy the taste and aroma. Stretch. Dress up as though you were going to work, no lounging in your pajamas. Have the strong intention of having a very productive day.

2 Find time for Meditation, Silence or Prayer-certainly, the authors have spent more time meditating in the last month than either of us had done any time previously. Remember the ancient saying: You should meditate once a day and if you don’t have time to do that you should meditate twice a day

3. Enjoy actively listening to beautiful music.

4. Express to family how much you care. Take advantage of the opportunity to cook together or clean the house. Surely, if you have a dog, he or she is somewhat bewildered by your constant presence and elated that you are home to spend more time with them.

5. Ask your neighbours how you could help them: maybe they could use your help with helping them get some food or medicines.

6. Connect (or re-connect) with old friends from your childhood, school and college on a regular basis. Enliven the conversation with upbeat stories and humour. Relive fun memories and collectively do something for people that are less fortunate.

7. Write a book if you haven’t done so already. Each one of us has a unique story to tell and share with the world.

8. Start the preparation for a TED talk. There are books and tips on how to do so readily available. At the least, it will make you a better speaker.

8. Exercise regularly. If you don’t like to do it don’t think of the effort and discomfort but instead of the way you will feel when you finish it. There is so much you can do with body-weight exercises. Get outside (as long as you maintain a 6-foot distance from others)!

Connecting with nature through flowers, birdwatching or gardening are all excellent way to get some fresh air and sunlight. The air is clean and crisp without so many cars on the road and the planet is getting much-needed respite to rejuvenate itself.

9. Learn a new language Hola, Ciao-(although you cannot travel to Spain or Italy yet, you will be ready for it when it’s time to go)!

10. Learn a new hobby: Bridge is something we know many friends are planning on learning. Dust off that old guitar, harmonica or flute sitting in your garage and you can enliven your home with your favourite melody, Surely, it will bring smiles and cheers all around.

11. De-clutter your home. It does more than clear up physical space. It will engender creativity.

12. If you are holding a grudge get rid of it. It’s only hurting you. As Nelson Mandela said when asked if he harboured resentment against his captors who had imprisoned him for 27 years: “I have no bitterness. I have no resentment. Resentment is like drinking poison and then hoping it will kill your enemies.”

13. Write a gratitude journal. If you are reading this, there is a lot more going right in your life than the things going wrong around us. Even once a week, (say Sunday evening) as you are taking stock of what’s in store the following week, reflect on what you are grateful for in the past 7 days and write it down! In the famous words of Johannes A Gaertner: “To speak gratitude is courteous and pleasant. To enact gratitude is pleasant and noble but to live gratitude is to touch heaven.”

Research has shown that writing down the things you are thankful for on a regular basis is one of the easiest and most powerful ways to enhance happiness.

Kintsugi is the Japanese art of putting broken pottery pieces back together with gold. It is built on the idea that by embracing flaws and imperfections, you can create an even stronger, more beautiful piece of art. And Rumi has said: The wound is where the light enters you.

Let’s permit the light to enter our collective wound and from it, we will emerge stronger, more resilient and resourceful and better connected with one another and the universe."

""As COVID-19 continues to spread, vulnerable communities within Pakistan are fighting hunger and to keep their families safe and healthy. Food aid must not be denied because of one’s faith,"" Anurima Bhargava, Commissioner, US Commission on International Religious Freedom said.



It comes in the wake of various news reports suggesting minority groups in Pakistan have been denied basic aid amid the coronavirus lockdown.

In Karachi, there have been reports that the Saylani Welfare International Trust, a non-government organisation established to assist the homeless and seasonal workers, has been refusing food assistance to Hindus and Christians, arguing that the aid is reserved for Muslims alone.



USCIRF Commissioner Johnnie Moore said, ""In a recent address by Prime Minister (Imran) Khan to the international community, he highlighted that the challenge facing governments in the developing world is to save people from dying of hunger while also trying to halt the spread of COVID-19. This is a monumental task laying before many countries. Prime Minister Khan's government has the opportunity to lead the way but they must not leave religious minorities behind. Otherwise, they may add on top of it all one more crisis, created by religious discrimination and inter-communal strife.""

Following the reports about Hindus and Christians in some parts of Karachi being denied food aid, other NGOs such as the Edhi Foundation and JDC Welfare Organisation had delivered rations to members of the two minority communities.



The Jamaat-e-Islami carried out disinfection spraying in temples and churches in Korangi and Clifton areas of Karachi and distributed cooked food and rations among Hindu and Christian families.

Karachi is home to a substantial number of Hindus and Christians. A majority of Pakistan’s Hindu minority live in Sindh province, of which Karachi is the capital.

Trudeau was all praise during his addressing them of the festival.



“In years past, families and friends would celebrate Vaisakhi by gathering at their local Gurdwaras to pray, read from the sacred scripture, and take part in vibrant parades and processions known as Nagar Kirtans. This year, as we continue to feel the impacts of the Covid-19 global pandemic, the Sikh community is celebrating differently, following the recommendations of our public health experts,"" he said as per a Hindustan Times report.

He had also earlier acknowledged the service the community was providing during the battle against the pandemic.
