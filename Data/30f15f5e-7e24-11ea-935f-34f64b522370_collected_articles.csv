Explained Should gloves be worn when outdoors? Gloves are necessary for COVID-19 patients and healthcare workers; there is still no recommendation that the general public should wear them. Many experts quoted by international media have said gloves should only be worn to protect healthcare workers from the fluids of an infected person. When dealing with a patient, a new pair of sterile gloves should be used.

Minutes after PM’s address, the Congress termed it as rhetoric and hollow on specifics, with a Shakespearean reference that it was “like Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark”. “A lot of talk has taken place. But, where is the roadmap to fight corona,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said. Senior Congress leader P Chidambaram said, “The poor have been left to fend for themselves for 21+19 days, including practically soliciting food. There is money, there is food, but the government will not release either money or food. Cry, my beloved country,” he said on Twitter.

Hours before Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address to the nation, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in a video message thanked those on the frontline in the fight against the pandemic. “What can be more patriotic that all of us fighting the pandemic together. Our coronavirus warriors are fighting this war despite lack of basic safety gear. Doctors, health workers, and volunteers are treating patients despite lack of protection kits,” Sonia Gandhi said, urging people to “follow the lockdown, respect the COVID-19 fighters and adhere to the social distancing norms”.

Gandhi also stressed that Congress supports the nation in the fight against the virus. “I want to assure you all that whether the Congress is in government or is in opposition, it is with you in this fight. I have firm belief that with great determination we will soon come out of the tragedy,” she said. After her video, BJP president J P Nadda thanked Gandhi in a tweet asking her to take care of her health.
